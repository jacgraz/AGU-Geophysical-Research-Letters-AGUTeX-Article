	abstract = {, The effect of turbulence on snow precipitation is not incorporated into present weather forecasting models. Here we show evidence that turbulence is in fact a key influence on both fall speed and spatial distribution of settling snow. We consider three snowfall events under vastly different levels of atmospheric turbulence. We characterize the size and morphology of the snow particles, and we simultaneously image their velocity, acceleration and relative concentration over vertical planes approximately 30¬†m230¬†m230{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textrm \{m\}{\textasciicircum}2 in area. We find that turbulence-driven settling enhancement explains otherwise contradictory trends between the particle size and velocity. The estimates of the Stokes number and the correlation between vertical velocity and local concentration are consistent with the view that the enhanced settling is rooted in the preferential sweeping mechanism. When the snow vertical velocity is large compared to the characteristic turbulence velocity, the crossing trajectories effect results in strong accelerations. When the conditions of preferential sweeping are met, the concentration field is highly non-uniform and clustering appears over a wide range of scales. These clusters, identified for the first time in a naturally occurring flow, display the signature features seen in canonical settings: power-law size distribution, fractal-like shape, vertical elongation and large fall speed that increases with the cluster size. These findings demonstrate that the fundamental phenomenology of particle-laden turbulence can be leveraged towards a better predictive understanding of snow precipitation and ground snow accumulation. They also demonstrate how environmental flows can be used to investigate dispersed multiphase flows at Reynolds numbers not accessible in laboratory experiments or numerical simulations.},

The focus is on spherical particles in homogeneous and canonical wall-bounded flows. The analysis of recent data indicates that conclusions drawn in zero gravity should not be extrapolated outside of this condition, and that the particle response time alone cannot completely define the dynamics of finite-size particles. Several breakthroughs have been reported, mostly separately, on the dynamics and turbulence modifications of small inertial particles in dilute conditions and of large weakly buoyant spheres. Measurements at higher concentrations, simulations fully resolving smaller particles, and theoretical tools accounting for both phases are needed to bridge this gap and allow for the exploration of the fluid dynamics of suspensions, from laminar rheology and granular media to particulate turbulence.},

The particle‚Äìfluid slip velocities show large variance, and both the instantaneous particle Reynolds number and drag coefficient can greatly differ from their nominal values. Finally, for sufficient loadings, the particles generally augment the small-scale fluid velocity fluctuations, which however may account for a limited fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy.},

It includes summaries of advances in the relevant satellite remote-sensing technologies and in methods to assimilate observations from these instruments into NWP systems. It also summarises impacts on forecast skill. Continued progress has been made on the assimilation of passive infrared (IR) sounding data and microwave (MW) sounding and imaging data. This has included data from hyperspectral IR sounders, which first became available during this period. Advances in the use of cloud-affected radiances, from both IR and MW instruments, have been made. In support of this progress, further developments have been made in fast radiative transfer models and in bias correction techniques, and work has continued to improve understanding and representation of observation uncertainties. Continued progress has also been made on the use of wind information from satellites, including atmospheric motion vectors and scatterometer data. A new source of temperature and humidity information, from radio occultation observations, has become available during the period and has been exploited by many NWP centres. The impact of satellite data on NWP accuracy is continually assessed using a range of methods and metrics. Some results from recent Observing System Experiments (OSEs) and Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI) assessment are presented and other methods are discussed. The role of satellite data in NWP-based atmospheric reanalysis systems is also described.},

	abstract = {The accurate simulation of microwave observations of clouds and precipitation are computationally challenging. A common simplification is the assumption of totally random orientation (TRO); however, studies have revealed that TRO occurs relatively infrequently in reality. A more appropriate assumption is that of azimuthally random orientation (ARO), but so far it has been a computationally expensive task. Recently a fast approximate approach was introduced that incorporates hydrometeor orientation into the assimilation of data from microwave conically scanning instruments. The approach scales the extinction in vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarised channels to approximate ARO. In this study, the application of the approach was extended to a more basic radiative transfer perspective using the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator and the high-frequency channels of the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI). The comparison of forward simulations and GMI observations showed that with a random selection of scaling factors from a uniform distribution between 1 and 1.4‚Äì1.5, it is possible to mimic the full distribution of observed polarisation differences at 166 GHz over land and water. The applicability of this model at 660 GHz was also successfully demonstrated by means of existing airborne data. As a complement, a statistical model for polarised snow emissivity between 160 and 190 GHz was also developed. Combining the two models made it possible to reproduce the polarisation signals that were observed over all surface types, including snow and sea ice. Further, we also investigated the impact of orientation on the ice water path (IWP) retrievals. It has been shown that ignoring hydrometeor orientation has a significant negative impact (‚àº20\% in the tropics) on retrieval accuracy. The retrieval with GMI observations produced highly realistic IWP distributions. A significant highlight was the retrieval over snow covered regions, which have been neglected in previous retrieval studies. These results provide increased confidence in the performance of passive microwave observation simulations and mark an essential step towards developing the retrievals of ice hydrometeor properties based on data from GMI, the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) and other conically scanning instruments.},

	abstract = {Numerical weather prediction systems still employ many simplifications when assimilating microwave radiances under all-sky conditions (clear sky, cloudy, and precipitation). For example, the orientation of ice hydrometeors is ignored, along with the polarization that this causes. We present a simple approach for approximating hydrometeor orientation, requiring minor adaption of software and no additional calculation burden. The approach is introduced in the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) forward operator and tested in the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). For the first time within a data assimilation (DA) context, this represents the ice-induced brightness temperature differences between vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarization ‚Äì the polarization difference (PD). The discrepancies in PD between observations and simulations decrease by an order of magnitude at 166.5 GHz, with maximum reductions of 10‚Äì15 K. The error distributions, which were previously highly skewed and therefore problematic for DA, are now roughly symmetrical. The approach is based on rescaling the extinction in V and H channels, which is quantified by the polarization ratio œÅ. Using dual-polarization observations from the Global Precipitation Mission microwave imager (GMI), suitable values for œÅ were found to be 1.5 and 1.4 at 89.0 and 166.5 GHz, respectively. The scheme was used for all the conical scanners assimilated at ECMWF, with a broadly neutral impact on the forecast but with an increased physical consistency between instruments that employ different polarizations. This opens the way towards representing hydrometeor orientation for cross-track sounders and at frequencies above 183.0 GHz where the polarization can be even stronger.},

	abstract = {Polarimetric radar can be used to identify various types of hydrometeors. Ice crystals of the varied growth habits depolarize and backscatter millimeter-wavelength radiation according to crystal aspect ratio, bulk density, and orientation, and the polarization state of the incident radiation. In this paper model calculations of the depolarization caused by various crystal types are extended from previous work, and Ka-band (8.66 mm) radar measurements of linear and elliptical depolarization ratios (LDR and EDR) from various ice hydrometeors are presented. The measurements for regular crystals are related to the models. Drizzle drops, which are quasi-spherical, serve as a reference. Signature discrimination in cloud systems with more than one type of hydrometeor is addressed. The model calculations illustrate the interplay of the parameters that control depolarization. They predict that in the depolarization signatures, crystals of the various basic planar and columnar habits should generally be most separable, one habit group from another and, to a degree, within each group when they occur in common, mature size distributions. It is verified in this and related papers that measurements of depolarization with a Ka-band dual-polarization radar provide good estimates of hydrometeor identity to separately distinguish drizzle, pristine crystals of various growth habits, graupel, and aggregates in winter storm clouds that have reasonable horizontal homogeneity over short distances (‚àº10‚Äì20 km). Characterization of the mix of two or three hydrometeor types is also possible, once the individual types are identified in some part of the cloud. Quantitative agreement between the measurements and the models, supported by snow crystal samples, was much better for EDR than for LDR; that is, EDR enabled more specific hydrometeor identification. However, LDR provided indications of randomness of crystal orientation and a wider decibel gap differentiating graupel from drizzle.},

	abstract = {The orientation of ice crystals affects their microphysical behaviour, growth, and precipitation. Orientation also affects interaction with electromagnetic radiation, and through this it influences remote sensing signals, in situ observations, and optical effects. Fall behaviours of a variety of 3D-printed plate-like ice crystal analogues in a tank of water‚Äìglycerine mixture are observed with multi-view cameras and digitally reconstructed to simulate the falling of ice crystals in the atmosphere.

 Four main falling regimes were observed: stable, zigzag, transitional, and spiralling. Stable motion is characterised by no resolvable fluctuations in velocity or orientation, with the maximum dimension oriented horizontally. The zigzagging regime is characterised by a back-and-forth swing in a constant vertical plane, corresponding to a time series of inclination angle approximated by a rectified sine wave. In the spiralling regime, analogues consistently incline at an angle between 7 and 28¬∞, depending on particle shape. Transitional behaviour exhibits motion in between spiral and zigzag, similar to that of a falling spherical pendulum.

 The inclination angles that unstable planar ice crystals make with the horizontal plane are found to have a non-zero mode. This observed behaviour does not fit the commonly used Gaussian model of inclination angle. The typical Reynolds number when oscillations start is strongly dependent on shape: solid hexagonal plates begin to oscillate at Re =237, whereas several dendritic shapes remain stable throughout all experiments, even at Re \&gt; 1000. These results should be considered within remote sensing applications wherein the orientation characteristics of ice crystals are used to retrieve their properties.},

	abstract = {Turbulence in clouds is known to enhance particle collision rates, as widely demonstrated for warm rain formation. A similar impact on ice growth processes is expected but a solid observational basis is missing. A statistical analysis of a 15-month data set of cloud radar observations allows for the first time to quantify the impact of turbulence on ice aggregation and riming in Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds. Increasing eddy dissipation rate (EDR), from below 10-4 to above 10-3 m2 s-3, yields larger ice aggregates, and higher particle concentration, likely caused by increasing fragmentation. In conditions more favorable to riming, higher EDR is associated with dramatically higher particle fall velocities (by up to 125\%), under similar liquid water paths, indicative of markedly higher degrees of riming. Our findings thus reveal the key role of turbulence for cold precipitation formation, and highlight the need for an improved understanding of turbulence-hydrometeor interactions in cold clouds. Liquid and frozen precipitation mainly forms by collision and subsequent aggregation of small particles. Collisions between cloud particles, such as droplets and ice crystals, are thought to be increased by turbulence. While this effect has been intensively studied for liquid-only clouds, the impact of turbulence on ice-ice collisional growth (aggregation) and ice-liquid collisional growth (riming) is expected but has so far been poorly quantified. We study the effect of turbulence on aggregation and riming based on a long-term remote-sensing data set of low-level clouds containing both ice and liquid particles, recorded at the Arctic site of Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard. Cloud radar observations are used to retrieve the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (i.e., the eddy dissipation rate; EDR), which is the relevant quantity driving increases in collision rates, and to characterize ice particle properties. We find evidence that higher EDR regimes enhance the aggregation of particles, and are associated with signatures of increased ice particle concentration, possibly caused by the production of particle fragments upon collision. In temperature regimes more favorable to riming, turbulence dramatically enhances the particles' fall velocity, denoting higher degrees of riming. Our findings thus highlight a key role of turbulence for the formation of precipitable ice. Relation between turbulence and ice growth investigated based on long-term remote sensing data set of Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds Higher eddy dissipation rate (EDR) correlates with larger ice aggregates, and possibly higher degrees of fragmentation High EDR is an essential component needed for the formation of rimed particles},

Disks ranging in diameter from 0.3 to 3 mm, and in Reynolds number Re=10‚Äì435Re=10‚Äì435Re = 10{\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}435, are dispersed in two air turbulence levels, with velocity fluctuations comparable to the terminal velocity. For each case, thousands of trajectories are captured and reconstructed by high-speed laser imaging, allowing for statistical analysis of the translational and rotational dynamics. Air turbulence reduces the disk terminal velocities by up to 35 \%, with the largest diameters influenced most significantly, which is primarily attributed to drag nonlinearity. This is evidenced by large lateral excursions of the trajectories, which correlate with cross-flow-induced drag enhancement as reported previously for falling spheres and rising bubbles. As the turbulence intensity is increased, flat-falling behaviour is progressively eliminated and tumbling becomes prevalent. The rotation rates of the tumbling disks, however, remain similar to those displayed in still air. This is due to their large moment of inertia compared to the surrounding fluid, in stark contrast with studies conducted in water. In fact, the observed reduction of settling velocity is opposite to previous findings on disks falling in turbulent water. This emphasizes the importance of the solid-to-fluid density ratio in analogous experiments that aim to mimic the behaviour of frozen hydrometeors.},

Thousands of trajectories are reconstructed for each disk type by planar high-speed imaging, using the method developed by Baker \& Coletti (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 943, 2022, A27). Most disks either fall straight vertically with their maximum projected area normal to gravity or tumble while drifting laterally at an angle {\textless}20‚àò{\textless}20‚àò{\textless}20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ. Two of the three disk sizes considered exhibit bimodal behaviour, with both non-tumbling and tumbling modes occurring with significant probabilities, which stresses the need for a statistical characterization of the process. The smaller disks (1 mm in diameter, Re=96Re=96Re=96) have a stronger tendency to tumble than the larger disks (3 mm in diameter, Re=360Re=360Re=360), at odds with the diffused notion that Re=100Re=100Re=100 is a threshold below which falling disks remain horizontal. Larger fall speeds (and, thus, smaller drag coefficients) are found with respect to existing correlations based on experiments in liquids, demonstrating the role of the density ratio in setting the vertical velocity. The data supports a simple scaling of the rotational frequency based on the equilibrium between drag and gravity, which remains to be tested in further studies where disk thickness and density ratio are varied.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study of the orientation of ice crystals in cirrus and midlevel clouds, based on the analysis of several cases of scanning polarization lidar observations. The maximum angle that crystals deviate from the horizontal plane is inferred at consecutive altitude levels by fitting angle-dependent measurements of the linear depolarization ratio and backscattered intensities to a theoretical model with a Gaussian distribution of tilt angles. The average deviation angle is linked to the angular variation of backscatter. A rare observation of so-called Parry-oriented columns is also given to highlight the different backscattering behavior with lidar angle. For planar crystals, two orientation modes are found that depend on cloud temperature. High-level cold ({\textless}‚àº‚àí30¬∞C) clouds show a maximum deviation angle of ‚àº1.0¬∞, whereas for warmer ({\textgreater}‚àº‚àí20¬∞C) midlevel clouds this angle averages ‚àº2.0¬∞. This difference is caused by variations in particle shape and fall attitude that depend on temperature, likely involving a transition from simple plates to more widely fluttering dendrites at the warmer temperatures. Polarization lidar scans are clearly uniquely suited for the study of ice crystal orientations in clouds.},

In particular, we focus on the analysis of the spatial distribution of the biases and the temporal variability of the sun measurements. We show that the metallic unions result in a nonnegligible sinusoidal-like spatial variability of the estimated biases (on the order of 7¬∞-8¬∞ for œÜdp offset and 0.4-0.5 dB for Zdr bias), as well as a drop in œÅhv in rain and a large temporal variability in the power measured by sun scans. These effects are compared with the measurements collected without a radome and with the measurements collected with a seamless monoblock radome on the same radar system. It is shown that operating without radome, when possible, has a positive impact on the data quality, largely reducing the spatial variability of the biases and increasing the œÅhv in rain. Similar performances, without the inherent risks, can be obtained as well with a seamless radome. Nevertheless, regardless of the form of operation, we advocate for monitoring the data quality as accurately as possible if quantitative applications are desired.},

	abstract = {Research on settling dynamics of snow particles, considering their complex morphologies and real atmospheric conditions, remains scarce despite extensive simulations and laboratory studies. Our study bridges the gap through a comprehensive field investigation into the three-dimensional (3D) snow settling dynamics under weak atmospheric turbulence, enabled by a 3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) system to record {\textgreater} a million trajectories, coupled with a snow particle analyzer for simultaneous aerodynamic property characterization of four distinct snow types (aggregates, graupels, dendrites, needles). Our findings indicate that while the terminal velocity predicted by the aerodynamic model aligns well with PTV-measured settling velocity for graupels, significant discrepancies arise for non-spherical particles, particularly dendrites, which exhibit higher drag coefficients than predicted. Qualitative observations of 3D settling trajectories highlight pronounced meandering in aggregates and dendrites, in contrast to the subtler meandering observed in needles and graupels, attributable to their smaller frontal areas. This meandering in aggregates and dendrites occurs at lower frequencies compared to that of graupels. Further quantification of trajectory acceleration and curvature suggests that the meandering frequencies in aggregates and dendrites are smaller than that of morphology-induced vortex shedding of disks, likely due to their rotational inertia, and those of graupels align with the small-scale atmospheric turbulence. Moreover, our analysis of vertical acceleration along trajectories elucidates that the orientation changes in dendrites and aggregates enhance their settling velocity. Such insights into settling dynamics refine models of snow settling velocity under weak atmospheric turbulence, with broader implications for more accurately predicting ground snow accumulation.},

This study analyzes and compares the long-term (1991‚Äì2010) data collected by these gauges at the Valdai experimental station in Russia. The results show that the Bush Gauge systematically catches more (snow and mixed) precipitation than the DFIR. Wind speed during precipitation is the most important factor related to gauge undercatch. The Bush Gauge measures 20‚Äì50\% more snow over a 12h period than the DFIR for wind speeds of 6‚Äì7m/s. Therefore, correction of the DFIR for wind-induced undercatch is necessary in order to best represent true precipitation. This study derives new correction equations for the DFIR measurements of snow and mixed precipitation. In comparison to previous analysis, the new equations suggest lower (by 3‚Äì6\%) snow undercatch by the DFIR relative to the Bush Gauge, which means better DFIR performance than what we documented before in the past WMO intercomparison. This result will affect the evaluation of national standard precipitation gauges against the DFIR. Our effort is underway to determine the impact of this discrepancy through field data collection in Canada and additional data analysis at selected WMO test sites.},

As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity.

As a result many universities are still lagging behind companies in helping societies become more sustainable. This paper analyses the texts of eleven declarations, charters, and partnerships developed for HEIs, which can be considered to represent university leaders‚Äô intentions to help improve the effectiveness of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The analysis was done against two sets of criteria: (1) the university system, including curricula, research, physical plant operations, outreach and engagement with stakeholders, and assessment and reporting; and (2) the texts‚Äô complexity, number of bullet points, and number of words. The analysis was done continuously; whenever a new element was found in a text it was added to the university system (first criteria set) and applied to the analysis of the other texts. In this way, the system was augmented with the following elements: collaborating with other universities; fostering transdisciplinarity; making SD an integral part of the institutional framework; creating on-campus life experiences; and ‚ÄòEducating-the-Educators‚Äô. The authors of the paper propose that for universities to become sustainability leaders and change drivers, they must ensure that the needs of present and future generations be better understood and built upon, so that professionals who are well versed in SD can effectively educate students of ‚Äòall ages‚Äô to help make the transition to ‚Äòsustainable societal patterns‚Äô. In order to do so, university leaders and staff must be empowered to catalyse and implement new paradigms, and ensure that SD is the ‚ÄòGolden Thread‚Äô throughout the entire university system.},

The analysis is conducted at four levels of the engineering education system. First, the individual level is dedicated to findings about teaching practices reported by instructors. Second, the institutional level brings together findings about the implementation and presence of ethics within engineering programmes. Third, the level of policy situates findings about engineering ethics education in the context of accreditation. Finally, there is the level of the culture of engineering education. The multi-level analysis allows us to address some of the limitations of higher education research which tends to focus on individual actors such as instructors or remains focused on the levels of policy and practice without examining the deeper levels of paradigm and purpose guiding them. Our approach links some of the challenges of engineering ethics education with wider debates about its guiding paradigms. The main contribution of the paper is to situate the analysis of the theoretical and empirical findings reported in the literature on engineering ethics education in the context of broader discussions about the purpose of engineering education and the aims of reform programmes. We conclude by putting forward a series of recommendations for a socio-technical oriented reform of engineering education for ethics.},

However, to retrieve accurate estimates of snow mass and rate, these observations require augmentation through additional information and assumptions about hydrometeor properties. The Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) provides information about precipitation characteristics and can be utilized to improve estimates of snowfall rate and accumulation. Here, the goal is to demonstrate the quality and utility of two higher-order PIP-derived products: liquid water equivalent snow rate and an approximation of volume-weighted density called equivalent density. Accuracy of the PIP snow rate and equivalent density is obtained through intercomparison with established retrieval methods and through evaluation with colocated ground-based observations. The results conÔ¨Årm the ability of the PIP-derived products to quantify properties of snow rate and equivalent density, and demonstrate that the PIP produces physically realistic snow characteristics. When compared to the National Weather Service (NWS) snow Ô¨Åeld measurements of six-hourly accumulation, the PIP-derived accumulations were biased only +2.48\% higher. Additionally, this work illustrates fundamentally diÔ¨Äerent microphysical and bulk features of low and high snow-to-liquid ratio events, through assessment of observed particle size distributions, retrieved mass coeÔ¨Écients, and bulk properties. Importantly, this research establishes the role that PIP observations and higher-order products can serve for constraining microphysical assumptions in ground-based and spaceborne remotely sensed snowfall retrievals.},

	abstract = {Observations of thunderstorms with a dual channel circularpolarization radar have provided dramatic indications of the buildup of the electric field inside the storms and of the sudden collapse of the field at the time of lightning. The indications are obtained by coherently correlating the simultaneous returns in the right- and left-hand circular polarization channels of the radar, and follow up on the pioneering observations of this type by Hendry and McCormick (1976). The correlation is estimated and displayed in real time and the results enable one to predict when a storm has the potential for producing a lightning discharge, and often to anticipate the occurrence of individual discharges. The observations detect the presence of electrically aligned particles, believed to be small ice crystals, which are aligned by the electrostatic field of the storm. The aligned particles cause the radar signal to become progressively depolarized as it propagates through an alignment region, giving rise to correlated right- and left-circular polarization echoes. The alignment direction can be determined from the phase of the correlation and is found to be predominantly vertical, indicating a similar electric field orientation. Weaker horizontal alignment is often observed immediately following lightning discharges, consistent with the idea that the aligned particles are ice platelets which fall with horizontal orientation due to aerodynamic forces. The observations have been found to reveal the onset of strong electrification in developing storms and to indicate when decaying storms no longer have the potential to produce lightning. By compensating for signal-to-noise effects, the variation of the depolarization with range can be determined. This provides detailed pictures of the alignment regions which could be used as tracers of ice crystal populations in storms. The pictures also show the spatial variation of the alignment directions, raising the possibility of remotely mapping the storm electric field structure. Finally, the depolarization rate results readily enable one to distinguish between liquid and solid precipitation in the storms.},

	abstract = {Interest in exploring the meteorological conditions favoring upward lightning from tall man-made structures has grown in recent years, largely due to the worldwide expansion of wind energy. To this end, instrumented towers existing around the world are the most suitable places to study upward lightning. In this context, an LMA network was deployed around the S√§ntis Mountain (northeast Switzerland) during the summer of 2017, in order to complement the long-term measurements currently held at the S√§ntis telecommunications tower, a lightning hot spot in central Europe. This campaign allowed, for the first time, to gather a comprehensive set of observations of self-initiated upward lightning emerging from the Tower. With the help of C-band dual-polarimetric radar data, the present work focuses on the meteorological conditions conductive to self-initiated upward lightning from the S√§ntis. The analysis revealed that the upward propagating positively charged leaders spread mostly horizontal above the melting level, after an initial short vertical path from the tower tip. After this initial stage, the majority of upward leaders were followed by a sequence of negative return strokes. The inception upward lightning under a stratiform cloud shield would be favored by the low height of the charge structure. From the obtained results, it turns out that a key feature favoring self-initiated upward lightning would be the proximity of the tower tip to the melting level.},

	abstract = {Detailed ground-based observations of snow are scarce in remote regions, such as the Arctic. Here, Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera measurements of over 55,000 solid hydrometeors‚Äîobtained during a two-year period from August 2016 to August 2018 at Oliktok Point, Alaska‚Äîare analyzed and compared to similar measurements from an earlier experiment at Alta, Utah. In general, distributions of hydrometeor fall speed, fall orientation, aspect ratio, flatness, and complexity (i.e., riming degree) were observed to be very similar between the two locations, except that Arctic hydrometeors tended to be smaller. In total, the slope parameter defining a negative exponential of the size distribution was approximately 50\% steeper in the Arctic as at Alta. Sixty-six percent of particles were observed to be rimed or moderately rimed with some suggestion that riming is favored by weak boundary layer stability. On average, the fall speed of rimed particles was not notably different from aggregates. However, graupel density and fall speed increase as cloud temperatures approach the melting point.},

	abstract = {Abstract The scattering properties of aggregates are studied herein. Early aggregates ({\textless}7 monomers) of branched planar crystals and mature aggregates (up to 100 monomers) of columns are randomly generated with varying assumptions about the monomer attachment processes and the orientation behavior during collection. The resulting physical properties of the aggregates correspond well with prior in situ and retrieved sizes and shapes. Assumed azimuthally uniform orientations during collection and monomer pivoting upon attachment resulted in flatter and denser aggregates. The column aggregates had lower density and more spherical shapes than the branched planar crystal aggregates. The scattering properties were calculated using the discrete dipole approximation for a set of orientation angles and transformed to spectral coefficients representing modes of orientation angle variability. The zeroth- and second-order coefficients dominate this variability, with the zeroth-order coefficients representing the scattering properties for randomly oriented particles. The second-order coefficients for backscatter showed differences between horizontal and vertical polarization increasing with density, and these coefficients for specific differential phase increase with both mass and density. Similarly, coefficients for the copolar covariance decreased with density. Rapid changes in the contributions to the radar moments from the second-order coefficients from low to moderate density were observed, likely due to the increasing presence of horizontally aligned monomers in the aggregate structure. Differences in how differential reflectivity and correlation coefficient evolve with the orientation distribution parameters suggest that these measurements, along with specific differential phase and reflectivity, provide complementary information about aggregate sizes, shapes, and orientation distributions.},

In this study, artificial snowflakes are produced by additive manufacturing and their drag coefficients are obtained by measuring the terminal velocity in a liquid container, matching the Reynolds number typically encountered in natural occurrences. The experimental results show that the convex hull of the particle is suitable to accurately predict the drag force with existing correlations. Since it is unfeasible to accurately measure the three-dimensional geometries of natural snowflakes, the approximation with the convex hull provides a useful simplification. Furthermore, the known shapes of the artificial snowflakes are used to develop correlations to estimate the most relevant three-dimensional descriptors to predict the drag of snowflakes from a two-dimensional projection onto an arbitrary plane.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Polarimetric radar-based hydrometeor classification is the procedure of identifying different types of hydrometeors by exploiting polarimetric radar observations. The main drawback of the existing supervised classification methods, mostly based on fuzzy logic, is a significant dependency on a presumed electromagnetic behaviour of different hydrometeor types. Namely, the results of the classification largely rely upon the quality of scattering simulations. When it comes to the unsupervised approach, it lacks the constraints related to the hydrometeor microphysics. The idea of the proposed method is to compensate for these drawbacks by combining the two approaches in a way that microphysical hypotheses can, to a degree, adjust the content of the classes obtained statistically from the observations. This is done by means of an iterative approach, performed offline, which, in a statistical framework, examines clustered representative polarimetric observations by comparing them to the presumed polarimetric properties of each hydrometeor class. Aside from comparing, a routine alters the content of clusters by encouraging further statistical clustering in case of non-identification. By merging all identified clusters, the multi-dimensional polarimetric signatures of various hydrometeor types are obtained for each of the studied representative datasets, i.e. for each radar system of interest. These are depicted by sets of centroids which are then employed in operational labelling of different hydrometeors. The method has been applied on three C-band datasets, each acquired by different operational radar from the MeteoSwiss Rad4Alp network, as well as on two X-band datasets acquired by two research mobile radars. The results are discussed through a comparative analysis which includes a corresponding supervised and unsupervised approach, emphasising the operational potential of the proposed method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract The problem of predicting the orientations of falling nonspherical particles has been addressed by the construction of a heuristic model that assumes the particles are subject to isotropic turbulence within or below the inertial subrange, that is, the Kolmogorov spectrum of eddies, depending on the particle dimensions. The rms tilt angle of a spheroidal particle of small eccentricity is determined by Langevin-type averaging over its equation of motion, taking into account the first-order restoring torque that arises when the stable fall mode is perturbed by either thermal or turbulent fluctuations. By invoking dimensional constraints concerning the nature of the main flow and turbulent stresses and by assuming the thermal and turbulent fluctuations are uncorrelated, an approximate expression for the variance of an assumed Gaussian orientation distribution for small tilt angles and small flow Reynolds numbers is obtained. The expression is then generalized to provide a semiquantitative, nearly Gaussian probability distribution for arbitrary tilt angles, particle aspect ratios, Reynolds numbers, and particle sizes relative to the Kolmogorov microscale length for particles that can be modeled as spheroids, disks, and cylinders, as well as hexagonal plug and columns such as ice crystals.},

Particle scattering is calculated using the T matrix, which is ideally suited for spheroids in the Mie region. The T matrix, is calculated once for a given wavelength, particle size, shape, and dielectric constant, making full use of symmetry through use of a body coordinate system attached to the particle. For various orientations of the particle symmetry axis and for various radar elevation angles, a separate laboratory coordinate system is used. The scattering amplitudes and polarization basis vectors are transformed between the two coordinate systems using geometrical transformations. Two particle orientation distributions, which are two-dimensional in Œ∏, œï, are considered. These are the Gaussian and simple harmonic in Œ∏ with random œï. Sample calculations are presented for a 5:1 prolate spheroid, which is used to model falling needles/columns preferentially oriented due to vertical electric field. An oblate ice particle (axis ratio = 0.8) is used to model the fall mode of large hailstones. Whereas the horizontal‚Äìvertical polarization basis is used here, the Mueller matrix for other orthogonal bases can be easily derived.},

POLARRIS is composed of forward (POLARRIS-f) and inverse (retrieval and diagnostic) components (iPOLARRIS) to generate not only polarimetric radar observables (Zh, Zdr, Kdp, œÅhv) but also radar-consistent geophysical parameters such as hydrometeor identification, vertical velocity, and rainfall rates retrieved from CRM data. To demonstrate its application and uncertainties, POLARRIS is applied to simulations of a mesoscale convective system over the Southern Great Plains on 23 May 2011, using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with both spectral bin microphysics (SBM) and the Goddard single-moment bulk 4ICE microphysics. Statistical composites reveal a significant dependence of simulated polarimetric observables (Zdr, Kdp) on the assumptions of the particle axis ratio (oblateness) and orientation angle distributions. The simulated polarimetric variables differ considerably between the SBM and 4ICE microphysics in part due to the differences in their ice particle size distributions as revealed by comparisons with aircraft measurements. Regardless of these uncertainties, simulated hydrometeor identification distributions overestimate graupel and hail fractions, especially from the simulation with SBM. To minimize uncertainties in forward model, the particle shape and orientation angle distributions of frozen particles should be predicted in a microphysics scheme in addition to the size distributions and particle densities.},

The inherent uncertainty in radar snow estimates that are based on the radar reÔ¨Çectivity factor Z is caused by the variability of snow particle size distributions and snow particle density as well as the large diversity among snow growth habits. In this study, a novel method for snow quantiÔ¨Åcation that is based on the joint use of radar reÔ¨Çectivity Z and speciÔ¨Åc differential phase KDP is introduced. An extensive dataset of 2D-video-disdrometer measurements of snow in central Oklahoma is used to derive polarimetric relations for liquid-equivalent snowfall rate S and ice water content IWC in the forms of bivariate power-law relations S 5 g1KDa1PZb1 and IWC 5 g2KDa2PZb2 , along with similar relations for the intercept N0s and slope Ls of the exponential snow size distribution. The physical basis of these relations is explained. Their multipliers are sensitive to variations in the width of the canting angle distribution and to a lesser extent the particles‚Äô aspect ratios and densities, whereas the exponents are practically invariant. This novel approach is tested against the S(Z) relation using snow disdrometer measurements in three geographical regions (Oklahoma, Colorado, and Canada). SigniÔ¨Åcant improvement in snow estimates relative to the traditional Z-based methods is demonstrated.},

The ability of conditional GANs to generate an ensemble of solutions for a given input lends itself naturally to stochastic downscaling, but the stochastic nature of GANs is not usually considered in super-resolution applications. Here, we introduce a recurrent, stochastic super-resolution GAN that can generate ensembles of time-evolving high-resolution atmospheric fields for an input consisting of a low-resolution sequence of images of the same field. We test the GAN using two data sets: one consisting of radar-measured precipitation from Switzerland; the other of cloud optical thickness derived from the Geostationary Earth Observing Satellite 16 (GOES-16). We find that the GAN can generate realistic, temporally consistent super-resolution sequences for both data sets. The statistical properties of the generated ensemble are analyzed using rank statistics, a method adapted from ensemble weather forecasting; these analyses indicate that the GAN produces close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs. As the GAN generator is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger than the images used to train it. It is also able to generate time series much longer than the training sequences, as demonstrated by applying the generator to a three-month data set of the precipitation radar data.

	abstract = {Intense snowfall sublimation was observed during a precipitation event over Davis in the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, from 08 to 10 January 2019. Radar observations and simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model revealed that orographic gravity waves (OGWs), generated by a north-easterly flow impinging on the ice ridge upstream of Davis, were responsible for snowfall sublimation through a foehn effect. Despite the strong meridional moisture advection associated with an atmospheric river (AR) during this event, almost no precipitation reached the ground at Davis. We found that the direction of the synoptic flow with respect to the orography determined the intensity of OGWs over Davis, which in turn directly influenced the snowfall microphysics. We hypothesize that turbulence induced by the OGWs likely enhanced the aggregation process, as identified thanks to dual-polarization and dual-frequency radar observations. This study suggests that despite the intense AR, the precipitation distribution was determined by local processes tied to the orography. The mechanisms found in this case study could contribute to the extremely dry climate of the Vestfold Hills, one of the main Antarctic oases.},

We perform sensitivity simulations that include ice-graupel collisions of a cold frontal passage to investigate whether these simulations can capture the event better and whether the vertical wind-shear had an impact on the secondary ice production (SIP) rate. The simulations are conducted with the Consortium for Small scale Modeling (COSMO), at a 1 km horizontal grid spacing in the Davos region in Switzerland. The rime-splintering simulations could not reproduce the high ice number concentrations, produced too large ice particles and therefore overestimated the radar reflectivity. The collisional-breakup simulations reproduced both the measured horizontal reflectivity and the ground-based observations of hydrometeor number concentration more accurately (\&sim; 20 L$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$). During 14:30\&ndash;15:45 UTC the vertical wind shear strengthened by 60 \% within the region favorable for SIP. Calculation of the mutual information between the SIP rate and vertical wind shear and updraft velocity suggested that the SIP rate is best predicted by the vertical wind shear rather than the updraft velocity. The ice-graupel simulations were insensitive to the conversion rate size restriction from ice to graupel and snow to graupel.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract. On 28¬†February¬†2018, 57‚Äâmm of precipitation associated with a warm conveyor belt (WCB) fell within 21‚Äâh over South Korea. To investigate how the large-scale circulation influenced the microphysics of this intense precipitation event, we used radar measurements, snowflake photographs and radiosounding data from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (ICE-POP 2018).
The WCB was identified with trajectories computed with analysis wind fields from the Integrated Forecast System global atmospheric model. The WCB was collocated with a zone of enhanced wind speed of up to 45‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1 at 6500‚Äâm‚Äâa.s.l., as measured by a radiosonde and a Doppler radar. Supercooled liquid water (SLW) with concentrations exceeding 0.2‚Äâg‚Äâkg‚àí1 was produced during the rapid ascent within the WCB. During the most intense precipitation period, vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables show a peak and subsequent decrease in differential reflectivity as aggregation starts. Below the peak in differential reflectivity, the specific differential phase shift continues to increase, indicating early riming of oblate crystals and secondary ice generation. We hypothesise that the SLW produced in the WCB led to intense riming. Moreover, embedded updraughts in the WCB and turbulence at its lower boundary enhanced aggregation by increasing the probability of collisions between particles.
This suggests that both aggregation and riming occurred prominently in this WCB. This case study shows how the large-scale atmospheric flow of a WCB provides ideal conditions for rapid precipitation growth involving SLW production, riming and aggregation. Future microphysical studies should also investigate the synoptic conditions to understand how observed processes in clouds are related to large-scale circulation.},

Campaign activities were founded upon the sensitivities of a low-cost, core instrumentation suite consisting of Micro Rain Radar, Precipitation Imaging Package, and Multi-Angle Snow Camera. These instruments are highly portable to remote field sites and, considered together, provide a unique and complementary set of snowfall observations including snowflake habit, particle size distributions, fall speeds, surface snowfall accumulations, and vertical profiles of radar moments and snow water content. These snow-specific parameters, used in combination with existing observations from the field sites such as snow gauge accumulations and ambient weather conditions, allow for advanced studies of snowfall processes. HiLaMS observations were used to 1) successfully develop a combined radar and in situ microphysical property retrieval scheme to estimate both surface snowfall accumulation and the vertical profile of snow water content, 2) identify the predominant snowfall regimes at Haukeliseter and Kiruna and characterize associated macrophysical and microphysical properties, snowfall production, and meteorological conditions, and 3) identify biases in the HARMONIE-AROME numerical weather prediction model for forecasts of snowfall accumulations and vertical profiles of snow water content for the distinct snowfall regimes observed at the mountainous Haukeliseter site. HiLaMS activities and results suggest value in the deployment of this enhanced snow observing instrumentation suite to new and diverse high-latitude locations that may be underrepresented in climate and weather process studies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT An approach is suggested to relate measurements of radar depolarization ratios and aspect ratios of predominant hydrometeors in nonprecipitating and weakly precipitating layers of winter clouds. The trends of elevation angle dependencies of depolarization ratios are first used to distinguish between columnar-type and plate-type particles. For the established particle type, values of depolarization ratios observed at certain elevation angles, for which the influence of particle orientation is minimal, are then used to estimate aspect ratios when information on particle effective bulk density is assumed or inferred from other measurements. The use of different polarizations, including circular, slant-45¬∞ linear, and two elliptical polarizations, is discussed. These two elliptical polarizations are quasi-circular and quasi-linear slant-45¬∞ linear, and both are currently achievable with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Technology Laboratory‚Äôs K‚Çê-band radar. In comparison with the true circular and slant-45¬∞ linear polarizations, the discussed elliptical polarizations provide a stronger signal in the "weak" radar receiver channel; however, it is at the expense of diminished dynamic range of depolarization ratio variations. For depolarization measurements at the radar elevation angles that do not show much sensitivity to particle orientations, the available quasi-circular polarization provides a better depolarization contrast between nonspherical and spherical particles than does the available quasi-linear slant-45¬∞polarization. The use of the proposed approach is illustrated with the experimental data collected during a recent field experiment. It is shown that it allows successful differentiation among pristine planar crystals, rimed planar crystals, long columns, blocky columns, and graupel. When a reasonable assumption about particle bulk density is made, quantitative estimates of particle aspect ratios from radar depolarization data are in good agreement with in situ observations. Uncertainties of particle aspect ratios estimated from depolarization measurements due to 0.1 g cm‚àí3 variations in the assumed bulk density are about 0.1.},

The datasets have been collected at five different sites. A W-band Doppler cloud profilers and a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) have been deployed in the immediate proximity of the main building of the station. An X-band dual-polarization Doppler scanning weather radar was installed 1.9 km south-east of PEA. Information on the various hydrometeor types have been derived from its measurements, as well as from the images collected by the MASC. The remaining three sites were located in a transect across the mountain chain south of the base, between 7 and 17 km apart from each other. At each site, a K-band Doppler profiler and an automated weather station have been deployed. A pyrgeometer and a pyranometer accompanied the instruments at the site in the middle of the transect. A case study, covering the precipitation event recorded on 23 December 2019, is presented to illustrate the various datasets. Overall, the availability of radar measurements over a complex terrain, relatively far from a scientific base, is extremely rare in the Antarctic context, and opens a wide range of possibilities for precipitation studies over the region.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study presents estimates of flutter and analyzes predominant fall attitudes of pristine dendritic crystals observed with a polarization agile Ka-band cloud radar. The observations were made in weakly precipitating winter clouds on slopes of Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. The radar is capable of measuring the linear depolarization ratios in the standard horizontal‚Äìvertical polarization basis (HLDR) and the slant 45¬∞‚Äì135¬∞ polarization basis (SLDR). Both HLDR and SLDR depend on crystal shape. HLDR also exhibits a strong dependence on crystal orientation, while SLDR depends only weakly on orientation. The different sensitivities of SLDR and HLDR to the shape and orientation effects are interpreted to estimate the angular flutter of crystals. A simple analytical expression is derived for the standard deviation of angular flutter as a function of the HLDR to SLDR ratio assuming perfect radar system characteristics. The flutter is also assessed by matching theoretical and observed depolarization patterns as a function of the elevation of the radar‚Äôs beam. The matching procedure is generally more robust since it accounts for the actual polarization states and imperfections in the radar hardware. The depolarization approach was used to estimate flutter of falling pristine dendrites that were characterized by Reynolds numbers in a range of approximately 40‚Äì100. Using the matching approach, this flutter was found to be about 9¬∞ ¬± 3¬∞, as expressed by the standard deviation of the crystal minor axes from the vertical direction. The analytical expression provides a value of flutter of about 12¬∞, which is at the high end of the estimate obtained by the matching procedure. The difference is explained by the imperfections in the polarization states and radar hardware, so the analytical result serves as an upper bound to the more robust result from matching. The values of flutter estimated from the experimental example are comparable to estimates for planar crystals obtained in laboratory models and by individual crystal sampling.},

	abstract = {Abstract The assumed relationship between ice particle mass and size is profoundly important in radar retrievals of ice clouds, but, for millimeter-wave radars, shape and preferred orientation are important as well. In this paper the authors first examine the consequences of the fact that the widely used ‚ÄúBrown and Francis‚Äù mass‚Äìsize relationship has often been applied to maximum particle dimension observed by aircraft Dmax rather than to the mean of the particle dimensions in two orthogonal directions Dmean, which was originally used by Brown and Francis. Analysis of particle images reveals that Dmax ‚âÉ 1.25Dmean, and therefore, for clouds for which this mass‚Äìsize relationship holds, the consequences are overestimates of ice water content by around 53\% and of Rayleigh-scattering radar reflectivity factor by 3.7 dB. Simultaneous radar and aircraft measurements demonstrate that much better agreement in reflectivity factor is provided by using this mass‚Äìsize relationship with Dmean. The authors then examine the importance of particle shape and fall orientation for millimeter-wave radars. Simultaneous radar measurements and aircraft calculations of differential reflectivity and dual-wavelength ratio are presented to demonstrate that ice particles may usually be treated as horizontally aligned oblate spheroids with an axial ratio of 0.6, consistent with them being aggregates. An accurate formula is presented for the backscatter cross section apparent to a vertically pointing millimeter-wave radar on the basis of a modified version of Rayleigh‚ÄìGans theory. It is then shown that the consequence of treating ice particles as Mie-scattering spheres is to substantially underestimate millimeter-wave reflectivity factor when millimeter-sized particles are present, which can lead to retrieved ice water content being overestimated by a factor of 4.},

	abstract = {Climate model parametrization relies strongly on the prediction of snow precipitation, which in turn depends upon the snowflakes falling motion in air. The falling attitudes of such particles are elaborate because of the particles' irregular shapes, which produce meandering and turbulent wakes and give rise to convoluted trajectories. This also has an impact on the drag experienced by the particle. Especially for large snow particles falling close to the ground, Stokesian dynamics is not applicable, and the dependency of drag coefficient on Reynolds number becomes non-linear. This trend arises from the complex interaction between snowflakes and the surrounding air. We investigate the wake of complex-shaped snow particles using a validated delayed-detached eddy simulation model of airflow around a fixed snowflake, combined with experimental observations of free-falling, 3D-printed snowflake analogs. This novel approach allows us to analyze the wake topology and decompose its momentum flux to investigate the influence of shape and wake flow on the drag coefficient and its implications on falling attitudes by comparison with experiments. At low Re, the presence of separated vortex rings is connected to particle porosity and produces an increase in the drag coefficient. At moderate flow regimes, the particle flatness impacts the shear layer separation and the momentum loss in the wake, while at high Re the drag coefficient has almost the same value among the tested geometries although the contribution of different momentum flux terms differs. These results represent a further step toward a deeper understanding the drag of complex-shaped particles.},

In this study, laboratory measurements of the terminal velocity œÖt for a variety of ice particle models settling in viscous fluids, along with wind-tunnel and field measurements of ice particles settling in air, have been analyzed and compared to common methods of computing œÖt from the literature. It is observed that while these methods work well for a number of particle types, they fail for particles with open geometries, specifically those particles for which the area ratio Ar is small (Ar is defined as the area of the particle projected normal to the flow divided by the area of a circumscribing disc). In particular, the fall speeds of stellar and dendritic crystals, needles, open bullet rosettes, and low-density aggregates are all overestimated. These particle types are important in many cloud types: aggregates in particular often dominate snow precipitation at the ground and vertically pointing Doppler radar measurements. Based on the laboratory data, a simple modification to previous computational methods is proposed, based on the area ratio. This new method collapses the available drag data onto an approximately universal curve, and the resulting errors in the computed fall speeds relative to the tank data are less than 25\% in all cases. Comparison with the (much more scattered) measurements of ice particles falling in air show strong support for this new method, with the area ratio bias apparently eliminated.},

	abstract = {Abstract Techniques for the absolute calibration of radar reflectivity Z and differential reflectivity ZDR measured with dual-polarization weather radars are examined herein. Calibration of Z is based on the idea of self-consistency among Z, ZDR, and the specific differential phase KDP in rain. Extensive spatial and temporal averaging is used to derive the average values of ZDR and KDP for each 1 dB step in Z. Such averaging substantially reduces the standard error of the KDP estimate so the technique can be used for a wide range of rain intensities, including light rain. In this paper, the performance of different consistency relations is analyzed and a new self-consistency methodology is suggested. The proposed scheme substantially reduces the impact of variability in the drop size distribution and raindrop shape on the quality of the Z calibration. The new calibration technique was tested on a large polarimetric dataset obtained during the Joint Polarization Experiment in Oklahoma and yielded an accuracy of Z calibration within 1 dB. Absolute calibration of ZDR is performed using solar measurements at orthogonal polarizations and polarimetric properties of natural targets like light rain and dry aggregated snow that are probed at high elevation angles. Because vertical sounding is prohibited for operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars because of mechanical constraints, the existing methodology for ZDR calibration is modified for nonzenith elevation angles. It is shown that the required 0.1‚Äì0.2-dB accuracy of the ZDR calibration is potentially achievable.},

The aim of this letter is to analyze the quality of Kdp estimates, using realistic simulated fields of drop size distributions. Two classical and one recently proposed estimation algorithms are tested, which are chosen among the algorithms that use the measured and noisy total differential phase shift Œ®dp as their main input. A data set of six simulated rain events, from which polarimetric radar variables can be derived, is employed in this letter. The mean normalized absolute error in the estimation of Kdp at the radar resolution volume scale ranges from 27\% to 30\% for all the algorithms proposed, and significant negative biases up to -50\% emerge at the highest values of Kdp for the most biased algorithm. The new algorithm, which is based on Kalman filtering, is able to keep these localized bias values around -25\% and outperforms the classical algorithms in terms of efficiency, correlation, and root-mean-square error.},

	abstract = {Abstract Polarimetric radar observations above the melting layer in winter storms reveal enhanced differential reflectivity ZDR and specific differential phase shift KDP, collocated with reduced copolar correlation coefficient œÅhv; these signatures often appear as isolated ‚Äúpockets.‚Äù High-resolution RHIs and vertical profiles of polarimetric variables were analyzed for a winter storm that occurred in Oklahoma on 27 January 2009, observed with the polarimetric Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) in Norman. The ZDR maximum and œÅhv minimum are located within the temperature range between ‚àí10¬∞ and ‚àí15¬∞C, whereas the KDP maximum is located just below the ZDR maximum. These signatures are coincident with reflectivity factor ZH that increases toward the ground. A simple kinematical, one-dimensional, two-moment bulk microphysical model is developed and coupled with electromagnetic scattering calculations to explain the nature of the observed polarimetric signature. The microphysics model includes nucleation, deposition, and aggregation and considers only ice-phase hydrometeors. Vertical profiles of the polarimetric radar variables (ZH, ZDR, KDP, and œÅhv) were calculated using the output from the microphysical model. The base model run reproduces the general profile and magnitude of the observed ZH and œÅhv and the correct shape (but not magnitude) of ZDR and KDP. Several sensitivity experiments were conducted to determine if the modeled signatures of all variables can match the observed ones. The model was incapable of matching both the observed magnitude and shape of all polarimetric variables, however. This implies that some processes not included in the model (such as secondary ice generation) are important in producing the signature.},

This bimodality has been repeatedly observed in snow. At altitudes higher than the level at which the bimodality appears, the reflectivity of the snow rapidly increases at the same time as its fall velocity reaches values beyond those expected from the aggregation of snow crystals. This is indicative of riming by supercooled cloud droplets. We show here that the spectral bimodality observed in the snow after indication of riming may be associated with secondary ice generation or with supercooled drizzle. Higher snow content favors the formation of secondary ice, while in situations of low snow content, the presence of the supercooled cloud may lead to the formation of drizzle. In both cases, the bimodality indicates the significant content of the supercooled cloud. This type of observation can be used operationally to detect the supercooled water coexisting with the snow.},

	abstract = {In this paper it is discussed how dual-polarization radar observations can be used to verify model representations of secondary ice production. An event where enhanced specific differential phase, Kdp, signatures in snow occur at the altitudes where temperatures lie in the range between ‚àí8 and ‚àí3¬∞C is investigated. By combining radar and surface-based precipitation observations it is shown that these dual-polarization radar signatures are most likely caused by ice with concentrations exceeding those expected from primary ice parameterizations. It is also shown that the newly formed ice particles readily aggregate, which may explain why Kdp values seem to be capped at 0.2‚Äì0.3¬∞/km for a C band radar. For the event of interest, multiple high-resolution (1 km) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations are conducted. When the default versions of the Morrison microphysics schemes were used, the simulated number concentration of frozen hydrometeors is much lower than observed and the simulated ice particle concentrations are comparable with values expected from primary ice parameterizations. Higher ice concentrations, which exceed values expected from primary ice parameterizations, were simulated when ad hoc thresholds for rain and cloud water mixing ratio in the Hallett-Mossop part of the Morrison scheme were removed. These results suggest that the parameterization of secondary ice production in operational weather prediction models needs to be revisited and that dual-polarization radar observations, in conjunction with ancillary observations, can be used to verify them.},

	abstract = {Results are presented from a case-study in which the macrophysical and microphysical characteristics of a warm-frontal mixed-phase cloud were investigated using simultaneous aircraft and polarimetric-radar measurements. A region of embedded convection was located and sampled at various stages of its ascent through the cloud from ‚àí5¬∞ to ‚àí11¬∞, and evidence is presented that it was triggered by Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability near the melting layer. High concentrations of small crystals were observed in and above narrow convective turrets, around 1 km across, that contained supercooled liquid-water droplets with an effective diameter of 24 ¬µm and riming ice particles. The area surrounding the turrets was found to contain pristine columns, and was strikingly visible to the radar as a broad plume of high differential reflectivity ZDR (around 3 dB), contrasting with the 0‚Äì0.5 dB range usually found in ice clouds. The columns observed in situ had axial ratios of around 5:1, in close agreement with the values predicted theoretically from ZDR assuming horizontal alignment of the crystals. We argue that the high concentrations of small ice crystals (up to 103 l‚àí1) observed in this case were splinters produced via the Hallett‚ÄìMossop mechanism in the riming process, and these then grew rapidly by deposition in the water-saturated environment into pristine columns. Later in the ascent the picture was complicated by the presence of a fallstreak containing large, low-ZDR aggregates which appeared to rapidly accrete the columns. A number of plumes of high ZDR were observed by the radar on the same day, each of which persisted for at least half an hour. In the vicinity of cloud top ‚àí15¬∞, the regions of high ZDR tended to spread out horizontally, and attain values as high as 7 dB. At these temperatures plates and dendrites are known to grow, so these ZDR observations are in good agreement with our theoretical finding that columns alone cannot produce values of ZDR greater than 4 dB, no matter how extreme their axial ratios, whereas planar crystals can attain values up to 10 dB. Embedded convection could clearly be important in determining the distribution of ice and liquid water in frontal clouds, which affects both cloud glaciation and the radiation budget, and is important for aircraft icing.

The present study describes a methodology for automatic ice crystal recognition using innovative machine learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have recently been perfected for computer vision and have been chosen as the method to achieve the best results together with the use of finely tuned dropout layers. For the purposes of this study, CNN has been adapted for the Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP) and the 2DS-Stereo Probe (2DS), two commonly used probes that differ in pixel resolution and measurable maximum size range for hydrometeors. Six morphological crystal classes have been defined for the PIP and eight crystal classes and an artifact class, for the 2DS. The PIP and 2DS classifications have five common classes. In total more than 8000 images from both instruments have been manually labelled, thus allowing for the initial training. For each probe the classification design tries to account for the three primary ice crystal growth processes: vapor deposition, riming and aggregation. We included classes such as fragile aggregates and rimed aggregates with high intra-class shape variability and commonly found in convective clouds. The trained network is finally tested through human random inspections on actual data to show its real performance in comparison to what humans can achieve.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The decoder network is first trained to emulate Doppler spectra from a set of microphysical variables, using simulations from the radiative transfer model PAMTRA as training data. In a second step, the encoder network learns the inverse mapping, from real measured dual-frequency spectrograms to the microphysical latent space; doing so, it leverages the spatial consistency of the measurements to mitigate the problem's ill-posedness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The method was implemented on X- and W-band data from the ICE GENESIS campaign that took place in the Swiss Jura in January 2021.

This large cooperative effort takes place during the winters of 2020‚Äì23 to study precipitation variability in winter cyclones to improve remote sensing and numerical forecasts of snowfall. Snowfall within these storms is frequently organized in banded structures on multiple scales. The causes for the occurrence and evolution of a wide spectrum of snowbands remain poorly understood. The goals of IMPACTS are to characterize the spatial and temporal scales and structures of snowbands, understand their dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical processes, and apply this understanding to improve remote sensing and modeling of snowfall. The first deployment took place in January‚ÄìFebruary 2020 with two aircraft that flew coordinated flight patterns and sampled a range of storms from the Midwest to the East Coast. The satellite-simulating ER-2 aircraft flew above the clouds and carried a suite of remote sensing instruments including cloud and precipitation radars, lidar, and passive microwave radiometers. The in situ P-3 aircraft flew within the clouds and sampled environmental and microphysical quantities. Ground-based radar measurements from the National Weather Service network and a suite of radars located on Long Island, New York, along with supplemental soundings and the New York State Mesonet ground network provided environmental context for the airborne observations. Future deployments will occur during the 2022 and 2023 winters. The coordination between remote sensing and in situ platforms makes this a unique publicly available dataset applicable to a wide variety of interests.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) is sensitive to short-term extreme meteorological events that can leave long-term impacts on the continent's surface mass balance (SMB). We investigate the impacts of atmospheric rivers (ARs) on the AIS precipitation budget using an AR detection algorithm and a regional climate model (Mod√®le Atmosph√©rique R√©gional) from 1980 to 2018. While ARs and their associated extreme vapor transport are relatively rare events over Antarctic coastal regions (‚àº3 days per year), they have a significant impact on the precipitation climatology. ARs are responsible for at least 10\% of total accumulated snowfall across East Antarctica (localized areas reaching 20\%) and a majority of extreme precipitation events. Trends in AR annual frequency since 1980 are observed across parts of AIS, most notably an increasing trend in Dronning Maud Land; however, interannual variability in AR frequency is much larger. This AR behavior appears to drive a significant portion of annual snowfall trends across East Antarctica, while controlling the interannual variability of precipitation across most of the AIS. AR landfalls are most likely when the circumpolar jet is highly amplified during blocking conditions in the Southern Ocean. There is a fingerprint of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on AR variability in West Antarctica with SAM+ (SAM‚àí) favoring increased AR frequency in the Antarctic Peninsula (Amundsen-Ross Sea coastline). Given the relatively large influence ARs have on precipitation across the continent, it is advantageous for future studies of moisture transport to Antarctica to consider an AR framework especially when considering future SMB changes.},

Separately modelling ice dynamics and SMB is the only way to project future trends. In addition, mass balance studies frequently use regional climate models (RCMs) outputs as an alternative to observed fields because SMB observations are particularly scarce on the ice sheet. Here we evaluate new simulations of the polar RCM MAR forced by three reanalyses, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2, for the period 1979‚Äì2015, and we compare MAR results to the last outputs of the RCM RACMO2 forced by ERA-Interim. We show that MAR and RACMO2 perform similarly well in simulating coast-to-plateau SMB gradients, and we find no significant differences in their simulated SMB when integrated over the ice sheet or its major basins. More importantly, we outline and quantify missing or underestimated processes in both RCMs. Along stake transects, we show that both models accumulate too much snow on crests, and not enough snow in valleys, as a result of drifting snow transport fluxes not included in MAR and probably underestimated in RACMO2 by a factor of 3. Our results tend to confirm that drifting snow transport and sublimation fluxes are much larger than previous model-based estimates and need to be better resolved and constrained in climate models. Sublimation of precipitating particles in low-level atmospheric layers is responsible for the significantly lower snowfall rates in MAR than in RACMO2 in katabatic channels at the ice sheet margins.

This estimate is consistent with a recent study based on precipitation radar observations and is more than twice as much as simulated in RACMO2 because of different time residence of precipitating particles in the atmosphere. The remaining spatial differences in snowfall between MAR and RACMO2 are attributed to differences in advection of precipitation with snowfall particles being likely advected too far inland in MAR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Of these, 721 572 crystals {\textgreater}50 Œºm were classified into crystal habits. When sorted by number, 30\% of the crystals were rosette shaped (mixed-habit rosettes, platelike polycrystals, and rosette shapes with side planes), 45\% were diamond dust (columns, thick plates, and plates), and 25\% were irregular. When sorted by area, rosette shapes comprised 50\%, diamond dust 30\% and irregular 20\%. By mass, the percentages were 57\% rosette shapes, 23\% diamond dust, and 20\% irregular. Particle size distributions as a function of maximum dimension and equivalent radius are compared with previous studies. Particles are generally found to be slightly larger than previous austral wintertime studies. In 2002, a polar nephelometer (PN) that measures scattering phase function was incorporated with one of the CPIs. Correlated measurements between the two instruments showed that 22¬∞ and 46¬∞ peaks in the phase function were present when diamond dust was recorded by the CPI, but not when rosette shapes were present. Visual observations confirmed the presence of 22¬∞ and 46¬∞ atmospheric halos in some, but not all, of the diamond dust events. No visual halos were observed when rosette shapes were precipitating. Average PN phase functions are presented for diamond dust and rosette shapes. The diamond dust and rosette-shaped ice crystals appear to be very similar in shape to those observed by CPIs in cirrus clouds. Cloud conditions at the South Pole that were associated with various crystal types are discussed, as are some effects of blowing snow.},

Currently, continent-wide assessments of snowfall are limited to information from the Cloud Profiling Radar on board the CloudSat satellite, which has not been evaluated up to now. In this study, snowfall derived from CloudSat is evaluated using three ground-based vertically profiling 24\&thinsp;GHz precipitation radars (Micro Rain Radars: MRRs). Firstly, using the MRR long-term measurement records, an assessment of the uncertainty caused by the low temporal sampling rate of CloudSat (one revisit per 2.1 to 4.5 days) is performed. The 10‚Äì90th-percentile temporal sampling uncertainty in the snowfall climatology varies between 30\&thinsp;\% and 40\&thinsp;\% depending on the latitudinal location and revisit time of CloudSat. Secondly, an evaluation of the snowfall climatology indicates that the CloudSat product, derived at a resolution of 1{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àò}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} latitude by 2{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àò}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} longitude, is able to accurately represent the snowfall climatology at the three MRR sites (biases\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;15\&thinsp;\%), outperforming ERA-Interim. For coarser and finer resolutions, the performance drops as a result of higher omission errors by CloudSat. Moreover, the CloudSat product does not perform well in simulating individual snowfall events. Since the difference between the MRRs and the CloudSat climatology are limited and the temporal uncertainty is lower than current Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) snowfall variability, our results imply that the CloudSat product is valuable for climate model evaluation purposes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The DGL has been found in the past to exhibit specific observational signatures in polarimetric and vertically pointing radar observations. However, consistent conclusions about their physical interpretation have often not been reached.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this study, we exploit a unique three months dataset of mid-latitude winter clouds observed with vertically pointing triple-frequency (X-, Ka-, W-Band) and polarimetric W-Band Doppler radars. In addition to standard radar moments, we also analyse the multi-wavelength and polarimetric Doppler spectra. New variables, such as the maximum of the spectral ZDR (sZDR$_{\textrm{max}}$), allows us to analyse the ZDR signal of asymmetric ice particles independent of the presence of low-ZDR producing aggregates. This unique dataset enables us to investigate correlations between enhanced aggregation and evolution of small ice particles in the DGL. For this, the multi-frequency observations are used to classify all profiles according to their maximum average aggregate size within the DGL. The strong correlation between aggregate class and KDP confirms the expected link between ice particle concentration and aggregation. Interestingly, no correlation between aggregation class and sZDR$_{\textrm{max}}$ is visible. This indicates that aggregation is rather independent of the aspect ratio and density of ice crystals. A distinct reduction of mean Doppler velocity in the DGL is found to be strongest for cases with largest aggregate sizes. Analyses of spectral edge velocities suggest that the reduction is the combined result of the formation of new ice particles with low fall velocity and a weak updraft. It appears most likely that this updraft is the result of latent heat released by enhanced depositional growth. Clearly, the strongest correlations of aggregate class with other variables are found inside the DGL. Surprisingly, no correlation between aggregate class and concentration or aspect ratio of particles falling from above into the DGL could be found. Only a weak correlation between the mean particle size falling into the DGL and maximum aggregate size within the DGL is apparent. In addition to the correlation analysis, the dataset also allows to study the evolution of radar variables as a function of temperature. We find the ice particle concentration continuously increasing from -18 \&deg;C towards the bottom of the DGL. Aggregation increases more rapidly from -15 \&deg;C towards warmer temperatures. Surprisingly, KDP and sZDR$_{\textrm{max}}$ are not reduced by the intensifying aggregation below -15 \&deg;C but rather reach their maximum values in the lower half of the DGL. Also below the DGL, KDP and sZDR$_{\textrm{max}}$ remain enhanced until -4 \&deg;C. Only there, additional aggregation appears to deplete ice crystals and therefore reduce KDP and sZDR$_{\textrm{max}}$.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The simultaneous increase of aggregation and particle concentration inside the DGL necessitates a source mechanism for new ice crystals. As primary ice nucleation is expected to decrease towards warmer temperatures, secondary ice processes are a likely explanation for the increase in ice particle concentration. Previous laboratory experiments strongly point towards ice collisional fragmentation as a possible mechanism for new particle generation. The presence of an updraft in the temperature region of maximum depositional growth might also suggest an important positive feedback mechanism between ice microphysics and dynamics which might further enhance ice particle growth in the DGL.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although the three stations are comparable, being situated close to the coastline of Antarctica, the meteorological conditions differ. While at Dumont d'Urville katabatic winds cause predominant strong and relatively dry surface winds from the interior of Antarctica, Neumayer and Halley are frequently influenced by easterly winds associated mostly with eastward moving cyclones. From April through October the wind field above 5 km is governed by a circumpolar vortex with westerly winds increasing in intensity with height. Dumont d'Urville represents a station at the edge of this vortex with extreme stratospheric wind velocities up to above 50 m s‚àí1.

Here I show that the two estimates so derived are in marked disagreement for the entire continent but concur for the interior area between 80¬∞ S and the pole. I conclude that the large discrepancy near the coast is due to a calculated poleward moisture transport that is smaller than the actual value, as a result of deficiencies in evaluating the effects of cyclones and surface winds at the coast. Improvements in the climatological atmospheric database should therefore make possible reliable estimates of Antarctic precipitation variations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Attenuation of the W-band (95 GHz) radar signal by atmospheric ice particles has long been neglected in cloud microphysics studies. In this work, 95-GHz airborne multibeam cloud radar observations in tropical stratiform ice anvils are used to estimate vertical profiles of 95-GHz attenuation. Two techniques are developed and compared, using very different assumptions. The first technique examines statistical reflectivity differences between repeated aircraft passes through the same cloud mass at different altitudes. The second technique exploits reflectivity differences between two different pathlengths through the same cloud, using the multibeam capabilities of the cloud radar. Using the first technique, the two-way attenuation coefficient produced by stratiform ice particles ranges between 1 and 1.6 dB km‚àí1 for reflectivities between 13 and 18 dBZ, with an expected increase of attenuation with reflectivity. Using the second technique, the multibeam results confirm these high attenuation coefficient values and expand the reflectivity range, with typical attenuation coefficient values of up to 3‚Äì4 dB km‚àí1 for reflectivities of 20 dBZ. The potential impact of attenuation on precipitating-ice-cloud microphysics retrievals is quantified using vertical profiles of the mean and the 99th percentile of ice water content derived from noncorrected and attenuation-corrected reflectivities. A large impact is found on the 99th percentile of ice water content, which increases by 0.3‚Äì0.4 g m‚àí3 up to 11-km height. Finally, T-matrix calculations of attenuation constrained by measured particle size distributions, ice crystal mass‚Äìsize, and projected area‚Äìsize relationships are found to largely underestimate cloud radar attenuation estimates.},

During a deep precipitating system over the Arctic on 7 December 2013, the radar recorded LDR values up to ‚àí15 dB at temperatures corresponding to the columnar ice crystal growth regime. These LDR values were also consistent with scattering calculations for columnar ice crystals. Enhancements in LDR were suppressed within precipitation fallstreaks because the enhanced LDR values of columnar ice crystals were masked by the returns from the particles within the fallstreaks. However, Doppler velocity spectra of LDR within the fallstreak distinguished populations of slower-falling particles with high LDR ({\textgreater}‚àí15 dB) and faster-falling particles with much lower LDR, suggesting that columnar ice crystals with high LDR coexisted with larger isometric particles that produced low LDR while dominating the total copolar reflectivity, thereby decreasing LDR. The measurements suggest that the columnar ice crystals originated in liquid-cloud layers through secondary ice production.},

Five classes of vertical profiles of reflectivity in rain were identified, with three of them having precipitation undergoing a transition between the solid and liquid phase. Only one of them, albeit the most common, showed a radar brightband signature. In-depth study of the bright band and its dependence on precipitation intensity reveals that the ratio of the brightband peak reflectivity to the rainfall reflectivity is constant at 8 dB below 0.5 mm h‚àí1 and then increases to reach 13 dB at 2.5 mm h‚àí1 and 16 dB at 5 mm h‚àí1. The equivalent reflectivity factor of snow just above the melting layer is on average 1‚Äì2 dB below the reflectivity of rain just below the melting layer, independent of precipitation intensity. The classical brightband explanation accounts for less than half of the observed reflectivity enhancement; the difference could be explained by effects associated with the shape and density of melting snowflakes and, to a smaller extent, by precipitation growth in the melting layer and aggregation in the early stages of the melting followed by breakup in the final stages. The brightband statistics were also significantly different for reflectivities in rain above 2.5 dBZ when observations were made with an X-band radar as opposed to the wind profiler because of the combination of attenuation in the melting layer and the fact that scattering from some of the large hydrometers above and within the melting layer depart from the Rayleigh approximation usually used to compute reflectivity. The bright band is often capped by a thin and faint dark layer, which tends to be more evident at weak precipitation intensifies.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the need to understand the microphysics and improve the remote sensing of the melting layer of precipitation, we have developed a numerical 3-D model for the melting of single snowflakes. The model uses the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method and is forced by surface tension that controls the flow of meltwater on the ice surface. Heat transfer from the environment to the snowflake is simulated with a Monte Carlo scheme. In model experiments with snowflakes of various sizes and densities, we observed that the meltwater tends to initially gather in concave regions of the snowflake surface. These liquid water regions merge as they grow, and as meltwater is added, they form a shell of liquid around an ice core. This eventually develops into a water drop. The observed features during melting are consistent with experimental findings from earlier research, which suggests that the model is adequate for exploring the physics of snowflake melting. The principal remaining uncertainties arise from the omission of aerodynamic forces from the model. The results suggest that the degree of riming has a significant influence on the melting process: During initial melting, liquid water is apparent on the surface of unrimed or lightly rimed particles, while rime provides a porous structure that can absorb a relatively large amount of meltwater. Riming also strengthens the connections between different parts of the snowflake, making rimed snowflakes less prone to breakup during melting, while unrimed ones break up rather easily.},

A characterization of these clouds on fine vertical scales is required in order to understand the microphysical processes within these clouds, and for model and satellite evaluations over this region. We investigated three examples of cloud systems collected by ship-mounted remote-sensing instruments adjacent to East Antarctica at latitudes between 64¬∞S and 69¬∞S. These cases allow us to examine the properties of midlevel MPCs, with cloud tops between 2 and 6 km. Midlevel MPCs contain multiple layers of supercooled liquid water (SLW) embedded within ice during the passage of cyclones. SLW layers are capped by strong temperature inversions and are observed at temperatures as low as ‚àí31¬∞C. Convective generating cells (GCs) are present inside supercooled liquid-topped midlevel MPCs. The horizontal extent, vertical extent, and maximum upward Doppler velocity of these GCs were 0.6‚Äì3.6 km, 0.7‚Äì1.0 km, and 0.5‚Äì1.0 m s‚àí1, respectively, and are consistent with observations from previous lower-latitude studies. Ice precipitation is nearly ubiquitous, except in the thinnest clouds at the trailing end of the observed systems. Seeding of lower SLW layers from above leads to periods with either larger ice particles or greater ice precipitation rates. Periods of supercooled drizzle lasting up to 2 h were observed toward the end of two of the three cyclone systems. This supercooled drizzle turns into predominantly ice precipitation as the result of seeding by ice clouds located above the precipitating SLW layer.},

to determining the dominant type of hydrometeor populating a given radar
sampling volume. In this paper we address the subsequent problem of inferring
the secondary hydrometeor types present in a volume ‚Äì the issue of
hydrometeor de-mixing. The present study relies on the semi-supervised
hydrometeor classification proposed by Besic et¬†al. (2016) but nevertheless
results in solutions and conclusions of a more general character and
applicability. In the first part, oriented towards synthesis, a bin-based
de-mixing approach is proposed, inspired by the conventional coherent and
linear decomposition methods widely employed across different remote-sensing
disciplines. Intrinsically related to the concept of entropy, introduced in
the context of the radar hydrometeor classification in Besic et¬†al. (2016), the
proposed method, based on the hypothesis of the reduced random interferences
of backscattered signals, estimates the proportions of different hydrometeor
types in a given radar sampling volume, without considering the neighboring
spatial context. Plausibility and performances of the method are evaluated
using C- and X-band radar measurements, compared with hydrometeor properties
derived from a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera instrument. In the second part,
we examine the influence of the potential residual random interference
contribution in the backscattering from different hydrometeors populating a
radar sampling volume. This part consists in adapting and testing the

It is found that stratiform precipitation, irrespective of the precipitation type at the ground and as opposed to convective systems, is characterized by well-pronounced positive differential reflectivity Zdr and Kdp values near the model-predicted ‚àí15¬∞C isotherm. The regions of enhanced Zdr and Kdp are likely related to the growth of dendrite crystals in the region where the difference between the saturation vapor pressure over water and the saturation vapor pressure over ice is greatest. Coincident C-band and X-band measurements, in conjunction with electromagnetic scattering simulations, demonstrate that Kdp scales with frequency, indicating that the ice particles in the vapor deposition preferential growth zone are Rayleigh scatterers. Peak values around 2.0¬∞ and 3.5¬∞ km‚àí1 are observed at C band and X band, respectively. Most noteworthy is that an extended analysis of hourly and daily vertical profiles of C-band data over 1 year has shown that Kdp observations around the ‚àí15¬∞C temperature level in stratiform precipitation are well correlated (0.8) with the reflectivity in the underlying rain layer.},

QVPs of transitional stratiform and pure snow precipitation are analyzed using WSR-88D S-band data, alongside their corresponding environmental thermodynamic High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model analyses. QVPs of KDP and ZDR are implemented to demonstrate their value in interpreting elevated ice processes. Several fascinating and repetitive signatures are observed in the QVPs for differential reflectivity ZDR and specific differential phase KDP, in the dendritic growth layer (DGL), and at the tops of clouds. The most striking feature is maximum ZDR (up to 6 dB) in the DGL occurring near the ‚àí10-dBZ ZH contour within low KDP and during shallower and warmer cloud tops. Conversely, maximumKDP (up to 0.3¬∞ km‚àí1) in theDGLoccurs within low ZDR and during taller and colder cloud tops. Essentially, ZDR and KDP in the DGL are anticorrelated and strongly depend on cloud-top temperature. Analyses also show correlations indicating larger ZDR within lower ZH in the DGL and larger KDP within greater ZH in the DGL. The high-ZDR regions are likely dominated by growth of a mixture of highly oblate dendrites and/or hexagonal plates, or prolate needles. Regions of high KDP are expected to be overwhelmed with snow aggregates and crystals with irregular or nearly spherical shapes, seeded at cloud tops. Furthermore, QVP indications of hexagonal plate crystals within the DGL are verified using in situ microphysical measurements, demonstrating the reliability of QVPs in evaluating ice microphysics in upper regions of winter clouds.},

It was found that values of specific differential phase KDP often reached local maxima of ‚àº0.15¬∞‚Äì0.4¬∞ km‚àí1 in an elevated layer near the ‚àí15¬∞C environmental temperature isotherm. The passage of these elevated positive KDP areas is shown to be linked to increased surface precipitation rates. Calculations using a microwave scattering model indicate that populations of highly oblate ice particles with moderate bulk densities and diameters in the ‚àº0.8‚Äì1.2-mm range can generate KDP (and differential reflectivity ZDR) values that are consistent with the radar observations. The persistent correlation between the enhanced KDP level and the ‚àí15¬∞C temperature regime suggests that rapidly growing dendrites likely played a significant role in the production of the observed KDP patterns. The detection of organized regions of S-band KDP values greater than ‚àº0.1¬∞‚Äì0.2¬∞ km‚àí1 in winter storms may therefore be useful in identifying regions of active dendritic particle growth, as a precursor to aggregate snowfall.},

The employed supervised algorithm is a support vector machine (SVM), trained over 60 s precipitation time steps labeled by visual inspection. In this way, eight dominant hydrometeor classes can be discriminated.

In this study, the quasi-vertical profile (QVP) technique (wherein data from a given elevation angle scan are azimuthally averaged and the range coordinate is converted to height) is extended and applied to polarimetric WSR-88D observations of six Northeast winter storms to survey their evolving, bulk vertical microphysical and kinematic structures. These analyses are supplemented using hourly analyses from the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model. Regions of ascent inferred from QVPs were consistently associated with notable polarimetric signatures, implying planar crystal growth when near ‚àí15¬∞C, and riming and secondary ice production at higher temperatures. The heaviest snowfall occurred most often when ascent and enhanced propagation differential phase shift () occurred near ‚àí15¬∞C. When available, limited surface observations confirmed heavy snowfall rates and revealed large snow-to-liquid ratios at these times. Other cases revealed sudden, large melting-layer excursions associated with precipitation-type transitions near the surface. RAP analyses failed to capture such complex evolution, demonstrating the added value of dual-polarization radar observations in these scenarios and the potential use of radar data for assessing model performance in real time. These insights are a preliminary step toward better understanding the complex processes in northeastern U.S. winter storms.},

The route includes ice divides between two ice-coring sites at Dome Fuji and EPICA DML. We determined the surface mass balance (SMB) averaged over various time scales in the late Holocene based on studies of snow pits and firn cores, in addition to radar data. We find that the large-scale distribution of the SMB depends on the surface elevation and continentality, and that the SMB differs between the windward and leeward sides of ice divides for strong-wind events. We suggest that the SMB is highly influenced by interactions between the large-scale surface topography of ice divides and the wind field of strong-wind events that are often associated with high-precipitation events. Local variations in the SMB are governed by the local surface topography, which is influenced by the bedrock topography. In the eastern part of DML, the accumulation rate in the second half of the 20th century is found to be higher by {\textasciitilde}15 \% than averages over longer periods of 722 a or 7.9 ka before AD 2008. A similar increasing trend has been reported for many inland plateau sites in Antarctica with the exception of several sites on the leeward side of the ice divides.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The spatial variability of snow accumulation was found to be large, on both annual and intra-annual timescales, and is attributed to the high frequency of moderate to strong winds at the site. Accumulation throughout the year was observed to be episodic in nature, with a small number of snow accumulation events producing the majority of the annual total accumulation for the site, averaging 0.174 m. In the intervals between observed accumulation events (up to several months), negative changes to snow surface height caused by sublimation and densification of the firn were quantified using an acoustic depth gauge. The rate of decrease in snow surface elevation was largest during the austral summer, as expected, and the overall change in snow surface elevation due to sublimation/densification during the year was estimated to be about ‚àí0.10 m. Using the precise timing of accumulation events provided by the acoustic depth gauge, meteorological surface observations, numerical model analyses, and satellite imagery were used to gain insights into whether the event was associated with precipitation or related exclusively to blowing snow and to diagnose the meteorological conditions producing the event. Meteorological conditions during the accumulation events were found to strongly support an association with precipitation events caused by mesoscale or synoptic-scale cyclones along the coastal margin. Dating of the accumulation profile using the dispersed tracer technique identified several other accumulation events that were not measured within the target area of the acoustic depth gauge, suggesting that snow accumulation data from a single acoustic depth gauge cannot be extrapolated over a broad area.},

EarthCARE will improve our understanding of cloud and aerosol processes by extending the invaluable dataset acquired by the A-Train satellites CloudSat, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and Aqua. Specifically, EarthCARE's cloud profiling radar, with 7 dB more sensitivity than CloudSat, will detect more thin clouds and its Doppler capability will provide novel information on convection, precipitating ice particle, and raindrop fall speeds. EarthCARE's 355-nm high-spectral-resolution lidar will measure directly and accurately cloud and aerosol extinction and optical depth. Combining this with backscatter and polarization information should lead to an unprecedented ability to identify aerosol type. The multispectral imager will provide a context for, and the ability to construct, the cloud and aerosol distribution in 3D domains around the narrow 2D retrieved cross section. The consistency of the retrievals will be assessed to within a target of +/- 10 W m(-2) on the (10 km)(2) scale by comparing the multiview broadband radiometer observations to the top-of-atmosphere fluxes estimated by 3D radiative transfer models acting on retrieved 3D domains.},

	abstract = {Abstract A new method to derive radar reflectivity‚Äìsnow rate (Ze‚ÄìS) relationships from scattering properties of different ice particle models is presented. Three statistical Ze‚Äìi relationships are derived to characterize the best estimate and uncertainties due to ice habit. The derived relationships are applied to CloudSat data to derive near-surface snowfall retrievals. Other uncertainties due to various method choices, such as vertical continuity tests, the near-surface reflectivity threshold used for choosing snowfall cases, and correcting for attenuation, are also explored on a regional and zonally averaged basis. The vertical continuity test in particular is found to have interesting regional effects. Although it appears to be useful for eliminating ground clutter over land, it also masks out potential lake-effect-snowfall cases over the Southern Ocean storm-track region. The choice of reflectivity threshold is found to significantly affect snowfall detection but is insignificant in terms of the mean snowfall rate. The use of an attenuation correction scheme can increase mean snowfall rates by ‚àº20\%‚Äì30\% in some regions. The CloudSat-collocated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR)-derived liquid water path is also analyzed, and significant amounts of cloud liquid water are often present in snowfall cases in which surface temperature is below freezing, illustrating the need to improve the arbitrary model-derived surface temperature criterion used to select ‚Äúdry‚Äù snowfall cases. Precipitation measurements from conventional surface weather stations across Canada are used in an initial attempt to evaluate CloudSat snowfall retrievals. As expected, evaluation with ground-based data is fraught with difficulties. Encouraging results are found at a few stations, however‚Äîin particular, those located at very high latitudes.},

It has been recognized that systematic errors in snowfall measurements are often observed as a result of the gauge geometry and the weather conditions. The goal of this study is to understand better the scatter in the snowfall precipitation rate measured by a gauge. To address this issue, field observations and numerical simulations were carried out. First, a theoretical study using finite-element modeling was used to simulate the flow around the gauge. The snowflake trajectories were investigated using a Lagrangian model, and the derived flow field was used to compute a theoretical collection efficiency for different types of snowflakes. Second, field observations were undertaken to determine how different types, shapes, and sizes of snowflakes are collected inside a Geonor, Inc., precipitation gauge. The results show that the collection efficiency is influenced by the type of snowflakes as well as by their size distribution. Different types of snowflakes, which fall at different terminal velocities, interact differently with the airflow around the gauge. Fast-falling snowflakes are more efficiently collected by the gauge than slow-falling ones. The correction factor used to correct the data for the wind speed is improved by adding a parameter for each type of snowflake. The results show that accurate measure of snow depends on the wind speed as well as the type of snowflake observed during a snowstorm.},

It is also shown that convection in the melting layer seems to recreate some of the structure that had been lost as snow fell.

The Arctic has seen a marked reduction in sea-ice extent throughout the year, with a peak during the autumn. A new record minimum extent occurred in 2007, which was 40\% below the long-term climatological mean. In contrast, the extent of Antarctic sea ice has increased, with the greatest growth being in the autumn. There has been a large-scale warming across much of the Arctic, with a resultant loss of permafrost and a reduction in snow cover. The bulk of the Antarctic has experienced little change in surface temperature over the last 50 years, although a slight cooling has been evident around the coast of East Antarctica since about 1980, and recent research has pointed to a warming across West Antarctica. The exception is the Antarctic Peninsula, where there has been a winter (summer) season warming on the western (eastern) side. Many of the different changes observed between the two polar regions can be attributed to topographic factors and land/sea distribution. The location of the Arctic Ocean at high latitude, with the consequently high level of solar radiation received in summer, allows the ice-albedo feedback mechanism to operate effectively. The Antarctic ozone hole has had a profound effect on the circulations of the high latitude ocean and atmosphere, isolating the continent and increasing the westerly winds over the Southern Ocean, especially during the summer and winter.},

The amount of water that reaches the ground surface is thereby considerably reduced. This paper investigates the synoptic conditions and the atmospheric transport pathways of moisture that lead to either virga ‚Äì when precipitation is completely sublimated ‚Äì or actual surface precipitation events over coastal Ad√©lie Land, East Antarctica. For this purpose, the study combines ground-based lidar and radar measurements at Dumont d'Urville station (DDU), Lagrangian back trajectories, Eulerian diagnostics of extratropical cyclones and fronts, and moisture source estimations. It is found that precipitating systems at DDU are associated with warm fronts of cyclones that are located to the west of Ad√©lie Land. Virga ‚Äì corresponding to 36\&thinsp;\% of the hours with precipitation above DDU ‚Äì and surface precipitation cases are associated with the same precipitating system but they correspond to different phases of the event. Virga cases more often precede surface precipitation. They sometimes follow surface precipitation in the warm sector of the cyclone's frontal system, when the associated cyclone has moved to the east of Ad√©lie Land and the precipitation intensity has weakened. On their way to DDU, the air parcels that ultimately precipitate above the station experience a large-scale lifting across the warm front. The lifting generally occurs earlier in time and farther from the station for virga than for precipitation. It is further shown that the water contained in the snow falling above DDU during pre-precipitation virga has an oceanic origin farther away (about 30{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{‚àò}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} more to the west) from Ad√©lie Land than the one contained in the snow that precipitates down to the ground surface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Surface mass balance (SMB) provides mass input to the surface of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and therefore comprises an important control on ice sheet mass balance and resulting contribution to global sea level change. As ice sheet SMB varies highly across multiple scales of space (meters to hundreds of kilometers) and time (hourly to decadal), it is notoriously challenging to observe and represent in models. In addition, SMB consists of multiple components, all of which depend on complex interactions between the atmosphere and the snow/ice surface, large-scale atmospheric circulation and ocean conditions, and ice sheet topography. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge and recent advances in ice sheet SMB observations and models, highlight current shortcomings, and propose future directions. Novel observational methods allow mapping SMB across larger areas, longer time periods, and/or at very high (subdaily) temporal frequency. As a recent observational breakthrough, cosmic ray counters provide direct estimates of SMB, circumventing the need for accurate snow density observations upon which many other techniques rely. Regional atmospheric climate models have drastically improved their simulation of ice sheet SMB in the last decade, thanks to the inclusion or improved representation of essential processes (e.g., clouds, blowing snow, and snow albedo), and by enhancing horizontal resolution (5‚Äì30 km). Future modeling efforts are required in improving Earth system models to match regional atmospheric climate model performance in simulating ice sheet SMB, and in reinforcing the efforts in developing statistical and dynamic downscaling to represent smaller-scale SMB processes.},

	abstract = {Compared to other regions, little is known about clouds in Antarctica. This arises in part from the challenging deployment of instrumentation in this remote and harsh environment and from the limitations of traditional satellite passive remote sensing over the polar regions. Yet clouds have a critical influence on the ice sheet's radiation budget and its surface mass balance. The extremely low temperatures, absolute humidity levels, and aerosol concentrations found in Antarctica create unique conditions for cloud formation that greatly differ from those encountered in other regions, including the Arctic. During the first decade of the 21st century, new results from field studies, the advent of cloud observations from spaceborne active sensors, and improvements in cloud parameterizations in numerical models have contributed to significant advances in our understanding of Antarctic clouds. This review covers four main topics: (1) observational methods and instruments, (2) the seasonal and interannual variability of cloud amounts, (3) the microphysical properties of clouds and aerosols, and (4) cloud representation in global and regional numerical models. Aside from a synthesis of the existing literature, novel insights are also presented. A new climatology of clouds over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is derived from combined measurements of the CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellites. This climatology is used to assess the forecast cloud amounts in 20th century global climate model simulations. While cloud monitoring over Antarctica from space has proved essential to the recent advances, the review concludes by emphasizing the need for additional in situ measurements.},

crucial for accurate projections of the future Antarctic climate. This is
particularly true for summer clouds which play a critical role in the
surface melting of the ice shelves in the vicinity of the Weddell Sea. The
pristine atmosphere over the Antarctic coast is characterized by low
concentrations of ice nucleating particles (INPs) which often result in the
formation of supercooled liquid clouds. However, when ice formation occurs,
the ice crystal number concentrations (ICNCs) are substantially higher than
those predicted by existing primary ice nucleation parameterizations. The
rime-splintering mechanism, thought to be the dominant secondary ice
production (SIP) mechanism at temperatures between ‚àí8 and ‚àí3‚Äâ‚àòC,
is also weak in the Weather and Research Forecasting model. Including a
parameterization for SIP due to breakup (BR) from collisions between ice
particles improves the ICNC representation in the modeled mixed-phase clouds,
suggesting that BR could account for the enhanced ICNCs often found in
Antarctic clouds. The model results indicate that a minimum concentration of
about ‚àº‚Äâ0.1‚ÄâL‚àí1 of primary ice crystals is necessary and
sufficient to initiate significant breakup to explain the observations,
while our findings show little sensitivity to increasing INPs. The BR
mechanism is currently not represented in most weather prediction and
climate models; including this process can have a significant impact on the
Antarctic radiation budget.},

During two summertime snowfall events, high-resolution simulations are compared to measurements from an X-band polarimetric radar and from a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). A radar simulator and a ‚ÄúMASC‚Äù simulator in Polar WRF make it possible to compare similar observed and simulated variables. Radiosoundings and surface-meteorological observations were used to assess the representation of the regional dynamics in the model. Five different microphysical parameterizations are tested. The simulated temperature, wind, and humidity fields are in good agreement with the observations. However, the amount of simulated surface precipitation shows large discrepancies with respect to observations, and it strongly differs between the simulations themselves, evidencing the critical role of the microphysics. The inspection of vertical profiles of reflectivity and mixing ratios revealed that the representation of the sublimation process by the low-level dry katabatic winds strongly influences the actual amount of precipitation at the ground surface. By comparing the simulated radar signal as well as MASC and model particle size distributions, it is also possible to identify the microphysical processes involved and to pinpoint shortcomings within the tested parameterizations.},

It focuses on the modeling of thin mid-level supercooled liquid water layers which precipitate ice. The standard version of WRF produces almost fully glaciated clouds and cannot reproduce cloud top turbulence. Our work demonstrates the importance of adapting the ice nucleation parameterization to the pristine austral atmosphere to reproduce the supercooled liquid layers. Once simulated, droplets significantly impact the cloud radiative effect by increasing downwelling longwave fluxes and decreasing downwelling shortwave fluxes at the surface. The net radiative effect is a warming of snow and ice covered surfaces and a cooling of the ocean. Despite improvements in our simulations, the local turbulent circulation related to cloud-top radiative cooling is not properly reproduced, advocating for the need to develop a parameterization for top-down convection to capture the turbulence-microphysics interplay at cloud top.},

The only water supply in Antarctica, precipitation, is poorly estimated from surface measurements. The onboard cloud-profiling radar of the CloudSat satellite provided the first real opportunity to estimate solid precipitation at continental scale. Based on CloudSat observations, we propose to explore the vertical structure of precipitation in Antarctica over the 2007‚Äì2010 period. A first division of this data set following a topographical approach (continent vs. peripheral regions, with a 2,250 m topographical criterion) shows a high snowfall rate (275 mm¬∑yr‚àí1 at 1,200 m above ground level) with low relative seasonal variation (¬±11\%) over the peripheral areas. Over the plateau, the snowfall rate is low (34 mm¬∑yr‚àí1 at 1,200 m above ground level) with a much larger relative seasonal variation (¬±143\%). A second study that follows a geographical division highlights the average vertical structure of precipitation and temperature depending on the regions and their interactions with topography. In particular, over ice shelves, we see a strong dependence of the distribution of snowfall on the sea ice coverage. Finally, the relationship between precipitation and temperature is analyzed and compared with a simple analytical relationship. This study highlights that precipitation is largely dependent on the advection of air masses along the topographic slopes with an average vertical wind of 0.02 m¬∑s‚àí1. This provides new diagnostics to evaluate climate models with a three-dimensional approach of the atmospheric structure of precipitation.},

In this study, we report on a persistent drizzle event observed by ground‚Äêbased remote sensing measurements at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The temperatures in the drizzle‚Äêproducing cloud were below ‚àí25 ¬∞C and the drizzle persisted for a period exceeding 7.5 hr. Using ground‚Äêbased, satellite, and reanalysis data, we conclude that drizzle was likely present in parts of a widespread cloud Ô¨Åeld, which stretched more than {\textasciitilde}1,000 km along the Ross Ice Shelf coast. Parameter space sensitivity tests using two‚Äêmoment bulk microphysics in large eddy simulations constrained by the observations suggest that activated ice freezing nuclei and accumulation‚Äêmode aerosol number concentrations aloft during this persistent drizzle period were likely on the order of 0.2 L‚àí1 and 20 cm‚àí3, respectively. In such constrained simulations, the drizzle moisture Ô¨Çux through cloud base exceeds that of ice. The simulations also indicate that drizzle can lead to the formation of multiple peaks in cloud water content proÔ¨Åles. This study suggests that persistent drizzle at these low temperatures may be common at the low aerosol concentrations typical of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean atmospheres.},

2019. Aeolus is a demonstrator mission to test whether winds measured by

improved weather forecasting. A comprehensive programme of calibration and
validation has been undertaken following the satellite launch in 2018, but,
so far, direct comparison with independent measurements from the Arctic or
Antarctic regions have not been made. The comparison covers heights from the
low troposphere to just above the tropopause. Results for each radar site
are presented separately for Rayleigh (clear) winds, Mie (cloudy) winds,
sunlit (‚Äúsummer‚Äù) and non-sunlit (‚Äúwinter‚Äù) seasons, and ascending and descending satellite tracks. Horizontally projected line-of-sight (HLOS) winds from
Aeolus, reprocessed using baseline 2B10, for passes within 100‚Äâkm of the
radar sites, are compared with HLOS winds calculated from 1‚Äâh averaged
radar horizontal wind components. The agreement in most data subsets is very
good, with no evidence of significant biases ({\textless}1‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1).
Possible biases are identified for two subsets (about ‚àí2‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1 for
the Rayleigh winds for the descending passes at MARA and about 2‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1 for the Mie winds for the ascending passes at ESRAD, both in winter), but these are only marginally significant. A robust
significant bias of about 7‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1 is found for the Mie winds for the ascending tracks at MARA in summer. There is also some evidence for increased
random error (by about 1‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1) for the Aeolus Mie winds at MARA in
summer compared to winter. This might be related to the presence of sunlight
scatter over the whole of Antarctica as Aeolus transits across it during
summer.},

	abstract = {Snow plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle and energy budget of the Earth, and remote sensing instruments with the necessary spatial coverage, resolution, and temporal sampling are essential for snowfall monitoring. Among such instruments, ground-radars have scanning capability and a resolution that make it possible to obtain a 3D structure of precipitating systems or vertical proÔ¨Åles when used in proÔ¨Åling mode. Radars from space have a lower spatial resolution, but they provide a global view. However, radar-based quantitative estimates of solid precipitation are still a challenge due to the variability of the microphysical, geometrical, and electrical features of snow particles. Estimations of snowfall rate are usually accomplished using empirical, longterm relationships between the equivalent radar reÔ¨Çectivity factor (Ze) and the liquid-equivalent snowfall rate (SR). Nevertheless, very few relationships take advantage of the direct estimation of the microphysical characteristics of snowÔ¨Çakes. In this work, we used a K-band vertically pointing radar collocated with a laser disdrometer to develop Ze-SR relationships as a function of snow classiÔ¨Åcation. The two instruments were located at the Italian Antarctic Station Mario Zucchelli. The K-band radar probes the low-level atmospheric layers, recording power spectra at 32 vertical range gates. It was set at a high vertical resolution (35 m), with the Ô¨Årst trusted range gate at a height of only 100 m. The disdrometer was able to provide information on the particle size distribution just below the trusted radar gate. Snow particles were classiÔ¨Åed into six categories (aggregate, dendrite aggregate, plate aggregate, pristine, dendrite pristine, plate pristine). The method was applied to the snowfall events of the Antarctic summer seasons of 2018‚Äì2019 and 2019‚Äì2020, with a total of 23,566 min of precipitation, 15.3\% of which was recognized as showing aggregate features, 33.3\% dendrite aggregate, 7.3\% plates aggregate, 12.5\% pristine, 24\% dendrite pristine, and 7.6\% plate pristine. Applying the appropriate Ze-SR relationship in each snow category, we calculated a total of 87 mm water equivalent, differing from the total found by applying a unique Ze-SR. Our estimates were also benchmarked against a colocated Alter-shielded weighing gauge, resulting in a difference of 3\% in the analyzed periods.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Precipitation over Antarctica is the main term in the surface mass
balance of the Antarctic ice sheet, which is crucial for the future evolution
of the sea level worldwide. Precipitation, however, remains poorly documented
and understood mainly because of a lack of observations in this extreme
environment. Two observatories dedicated to precipitation have been set up at
the Belgian station Princess Elisabeth (PE) and at the French station Dumont
d'Urville (DDU) in East Antarctica. Among other instruments, both sites
have a vertically pointing micro rain radar (MRR) working at the K¬†band.
Measurements have been continuously collected at DDU since the austral summer
of
2015‚Äì2016, while they have been collected mostly during summer seasons at PE
since 2010, with a full year of observation during 2012. In this study, the
statistics of the vertical profiles of reflectivity, vertical velocity, and
spectral width are analyzed for all seasons. Vertical profiles were separated
into surface precipitation and virga to evaluate the impact of virga on the
structure of the vertical profiles. The climatology of the study area plays
an important role in the structure of the precipitation: warmer and moister
atmospheric conditions at DDU favor the occurrence of more intense
precipitation compared with PE, with a difference of 8‚ÄâdBZ between both
stations. The strong katabatic winds blowing at DDU induce a decrease in
reflectivity close to the ground due to the sublimation of the snowfall
particles. The vertical profiles of precipitation velocity show significant
differences between the two stations. In general, at DDU the vertical
velocity increases as the height decreases, while at PE the vertical velocity
decreases as the height decreases. These features of the vertical profiles of
reflectivity and vertical velocity could be explained by the more frequent
occurrence of aggregation and riming at DDU compared to PE because of the
lower temperature and relative humidity at the latter, located further in the
interior. Robust and reliable statistics about the vertical profile of
precipitation in Antarctica, as derived from MRRs for instance,
are necessary and valuable for the evaluation of precipitation estimates
derived from satellite measurements and from numerical atmospheric models.},

Simulations using the Met OÔ¨Éce UniÔ¨Åed Model at 2.2, 0.5, and 0.1 km horizontal grid spacing were able to broadly capture the location, timing, and magnitude of the observed velocities, as well as reveal that they are due to small-scale orographic gravity waves resulting from the interaction between the coastal topography and strong easterly winds associated with a synoptic-scale cyclone situated to the north. The simulations indicated that the gravity waves are responsible for (i) temperature Ô¨Çuctuations which coincided with satellite-observed cloud variations in the vicinity of Davis, suggesting that they have a crucial role in the formation of cirrus clouds, and (ii) large vertical momentum Ô¨Çuxes in the troposphere. The waves are prevented from propagating into the stratosphere by the background winds turning from near-surface easterlies to lower stratospheric northerlies. As well as illuminating and quantifying the role that weather systems have in producing orographic gravity waves along the East Antarctic coastline, studies such as this should be exploited to improve the representation of key localized atmospheric processes in global climate models.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Antarctic continent is a vast desert and is the coldest and the most
unknown area on Earth. It contains the Antarctic ice sheet, the largest
continental water reservoir on Earth that could be affected by the current
global warming, leading to sea level rise. The only significant supply of ice
is through precipitation, which can be observed from the surface and from
space. Remote-sensing observations of the coastal regions and the inner
continent using CloudSat radar give an estimated rate of snowfall but with
uncertainties twice as large as each single measured value, whereas climate
models give a range from half to twice the space‚Äìtime-averaged observations.
The aim of this study is the evaluation of the vertical precipitation rate
profiles of CloudSat radar by comparison with two surface-based micro-rain
radars (MRRs), located at the coastal French Dumont d'Urville station and at
the Belgian Princess Elisabeth station located in the Dronning Maud Land
escarpment zone. This in turn leads to a better understanding and
reassessment of CloudSat uncertainties. We compared a total of four
precipitation events, two per station, when CloudSat overpassed within 10‚Äâkm
of the station and we compared these two different datasets at each vertical
level. The correlation between both datasets is near-perfect, even though
climatic and geographic conditions are different for the two stations. Using
different CloudSat and MRR vertical levels, we obtain 10‚Äâkm space-scale and
short-timescale (a few seconds) CloudSat uncertainties from ‚àí13‚Äâ\% up to
+22‚Äâ\%. This confirms the robustness of the CloudSat retrievals of snowfall
over Antarctica above the blind zone and justifies further analyses of this

The largest disparities are observed at low altitudes over high southern latitudes. These data sets are cross referenced to groundbased measurements from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) campaign at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Compared with AWARE observations, both 2BCL5 and DARDAR underestimate cloud occurrence below 1.5 km, with 2BCL5 and DARDAR distinguishing roughly one third of cloud occurrences observed by AWARE at 0.5 km. While DARDAR identifies greater cloud occurrences than 2BCL5 below 1.5 km, cloud occurrence values for the two data sets have similar differences relative to ground-based measurements. Therefore, the DARDAR retrievals of greater cloud occurrence at low altitudes are likely due to a larger quantity of false positives associated with radar ground clutter or attenuated lidar retrievals. DARDAR cloud occurrences match better with AWARE than 2BCL5 above 5 km. However, the likely underestimation of ground-based measurements at higher altitudes suggests DARDAR may underestimate high level cloud occurrence. Finally, both data sets indicate the presence of liquid containing clouds at temperatures within the homogeneous freezing regime, despite the fact that the ECMWF-AUX data set implemented in their processing clearly indicates temperatures below ‚àí38¬∞C. Using AWARE radiosonde (ECMWF-AUX) temperature data, we find that 2BCL5 detects 13.3\% (13.8\%) of mixed phase clouds below ‚àí38¬∞C, while DARDAR detects 5.7\% (6.6\%) of mixed phase and 1.1\% (1.3\%) of liquid phase clouds below ‚àí38¬∞C.},

changes in the total mass of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, including its
contribution to sea level rise. Despite continuous attempts to decipher
mechanisms controlling the local and regional SMB, a clear understanding of
the separate components is still lacking, while snowfall measurements are
almost absent. In this study, the different terms of the SMB are quantified
at the Princess Elisabeth (PE) station in Dronning Maud Land, East
Antarctica. Furthermore, the relationship between snowfall and accumulation at
the surface is investigated. To achieve this, a unique collocated set of
ground-based and in situ remote sensing instrumentation (Micro Rain Radar,
ceilometer, automatic weather station, among others) was set up and operated for
a time period of 37 months. Snowfall originates mainly from moist and warm
air advected from lower latitudes associated with cyclone activity. However,
snowfall events are not always associated with accumulation. During 38‚Äâ\% of
the observed snowfall cases, the freshly fallen snow is ablated by the wind
during the course of the event. Generally, snow storms of longer duration and
larger spatial extent have a higher chance of resulting in accumulation on a local scale, while shorter events usually result in ablation (on average 17
and 12‚Äâh respectively). A large part of the accumulation at the station
takes place when preceding snowfall events were occurring in synoptic
upstream areas. This fresh snow is easily picked up and transported in
shallow drifting snow layers over tens of kilometres, even when wind speeds
are relatively low ({\textless}‚Äâ7‚Äâms‚àí1). Ablation events are mainly related to
katabatic winds originating from the Antarctic plateau and the mountain
ranges in the south. These dry winds are able to remove snow and lead to a
decrease in the local SMB. This work highlights that the local SMB is
strongly influenced by synoptic upstream conditions.},

Radiosondes released at 12-h increments provide atmospheric profiles for evaluating the simulated thermodynamic conditions. Our findings show that the CAM6 simulation consistently overestimates (underestimates) cloud fraction above (below) 3 km in four seasons of a year. Normalized by total in-cloud samples, ice and mixed phase occurrence frequencies are underestimated and liquid phase frequency is overestimated by the model at cloud fractions above 0.6, while at cloud fractions below 0.6 ice phase frequency is overestimated and liquid-containing phase frequency is underestimated by the model. The cloud fraction biases are closely associated with concurrent biases in relative humidity (RH), that is, high (low) RH biases above (below) 2 km. Frequencies of correctly simulating ice and liquid-containing phase increase when the absolute biases of RH decrease. Cloud fraction biases also show a positive correlation with RH biases. Water vapor mixing ratio biases are the primary contributor to RH biases, and hence, likely a key factor controlling the cloud biases.

The uncertainty on snowfall rates of the MRR based on the Ze-SR relation are limited to 40\%, due to the propagation of uncertainty in both Ze as well as SR, resulting in some compensation. The prefactor (A) of the Ze-SR relation is sensitive to the median diameter of the snow particles. Larger particles, typically found closer to the coast, lead to an increase of the value of the prefactor (A = 44). Smaller particles, typical of more inland locations, obtain lower values for the prefactor (A = 7). The exponent (B) of the Ze-SR relation is insensitive to the median diameter of the snow particles. In contrast with previous studies for various locations, shape uncertainty is not the main source of uncertainty of the Ze-SR relation. Parameter uncertainty is found to be the most dominant term, mainly driven by the uncertainty in mass-size relation of diÔ¨Äerent snow particles. Uncertainties on the snow particle size distribution are negligible in this study as they are directly measured. Future research aiming at reducing the uncertainty of Ze-SR relations should therefore focus on obtaining reliable estimates of the mass-size relations of snow particles.},

But despite early successes in using GANs for unsupervised representation learning, they have since been superseded by approaches based on self-supervision. In this work we show that progress in image generation quality translates to substantially improved representation learning performance. Our approach, BigBiGAN, builds upon the state-of-the-art BigGAN model, extending it to representation learning by adding an encoder and modifying the discriminator. We extensively evaluate the representation learning and generation capabilities of these BigBiGAN models, demonstrating that these generation-based models achieve the state of the art in unsupervised representation learning on ImageNet, as well as in unconditional image generation. Pretrained BigBiGAN models ‚Äì including image generators and encoders ‚Äì are available on TensorFlow Hub (https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=deepmind\&q=bigbigan).},

Crystals of selected habit are grown on a vertical filament and subsequently melted or evaporated in reverse flow, with the velocity adjusted for appropriate fall speed to reproduce conditions of the melting layer. Nonequilibrium conditions are simulated for larger melting ice particles surrounded by smaller drops at a temperature up to œ©5¬∞C or growth of an ice crystal surrounded by freezing ice particles down to œ™5¬∞C. Initial melting of well-defined faceted crystals, as individuals or in combination, occurs as a water layer œæ10 ‚êÆm thick. For larger (œæ100 ‚êÆm) crystals the water becomes sequestered by capillary forces as individual drops separated by water-free ice regions, often having quasiperiodic locations along needles, columns, or arms from evaporating dendrites. Drops are also located at intersections of aggregate crystals and dendrite branches, being responsible for the maximum of the radar scatter. The drops have a finite water‚Äìice contact angle of 37¬∞‚Äì80¬∞, depending on ambient conditions. Capillary forces move water from high-curvature to low-curvature regions as melting continues. Toward the end of the melting process, the ice separating the drops becomes sufficiently thin to fracture under aerodynamic forces, and mixed-phase particles are shed. Otherwise ice-free drops are shed. The melting region and the mechanism for lowering the melting layer with an increasing precipitation rate are associated with smaller ice particle production capable of being lofted in weaker updrafts.},

In this study, the impact of the blind zone of CloudSat on derived snowfall statistics in polar regions is investigated by analyzing three 12 month data sets recorded by ground-based Micro Rain Radar (MRR) at the Belgian Princess Elisabeth station in East Antarctica and at Ny-√Ölesund and Longyearbyen in Svalbard, Norway. MRR radar reÔ¨Çectivity proÔ¨Åles are investigated in respect to vertical variability in the frequency distribution, changes in the number of observed snow events, and impacts on total precipitation. Results show that the blind zone leads to reÔ¨Çectivity being underestimated by up to 1 dB, the number of events being altered by ¬±5\% and the precipitation amount being underestimated by 9 to 11 percentage points. Besides investigating a blind zone of 1200 m, the impacts of a reduced blind zone of 600 m are also analyzed. This analysis will help in assessing future missions with a smaller blind zone. The reduced blind zone leads to improved representation of mean reÔ¨Çectivity but does not improve the bias in event numbers and precipitation amount.},

AWARE provided Antarctic atmospheric data comparable to several well-instrumented high Arctic sites that have operated for many years and that reveal numerous contrasts with the Arctic in aerosol and cloud microphysical properties. These include persistent differences in liquid cloud occurrence, cloud height, and cloud thickness. Antarctic aerosol properties are also quite different from the Arctic in both seasonal cycle and composition, due to the continent‚Äôs isolation from lower latitudes by Southern Ocean storm tracks. Antarctic aerosol number and mass concentrations are not only non-negligible but perhaps play a more important role than previously recognized because of the higher sensitivities of clouds at the very low concentrations caused by the large-scale dynamical isolation. Antarctic aerosol chemical composition, particularly organic components, has implications for local cloud microphysics. The AWARE dataset, fully available online in the ARM Program data archive, offers numerous case studies for unique and rigorous evaluation of mixed-phase cloud parameterization in climate models.},

Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) provided a highly detailed set of
remote-sensing and surface observations to study Antarctic clouds and
surface energy balance, which have received much less attention than
for the Arctic due to greater logistical challenges. Limited prior Antarctic
cloud observations have slowed the progress of numerical weather prediction
in this region. The AWARE observations from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide during December 2015
and January 2016 are used to evaluate the operational forecasts of the
Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and new simulations with the Polar
Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) 3.9.1. The Polar WRF 3.9.1 simulations are conducted with the WRF
single-moment 5-class microphysics (WSM5C) used by the AMPS and with newer
generation microphysics schemes. The AMPS simulates few liquid clouds during
summer at the WAIS Divide, which is inconsistent with observations of frequent low-level
liquid clouds. Polar WRF 3.9.1 simulations show that this result is a
consequence of WSM5C. More advanced microphysics schemes simulate more cloud
liquid water and produce stronger cloud radiative forcing, resulting in
downward longwave and shortwave radiation at the surface more in agreement
with observations. Similarly, increased cloud fraction is simulated with the
more advanced microphysics schemes. All of the simulations, however, produce
smaller net cloud fractions than observed. Ice water paths vary less between
the simulations than liquid water paths. The colder and drier atmosphere
driven by the Global
Forecast System (GFS) initial and boundary conditions for AMPS forecasts produces
lesser cloud amounts than the Polar WRF 3.9.1 simulations driven by
ERA-Interim.},

Satellite observations of precipitation by active sensors has been possible in the polar regions since the launch of CloudSat in 2006. Here, we use two CloudSat products to generate the Ô¨Årst multi-year, model-independent climatology of Antarctic precipitation. The Ô¨Årst product is used to determine the frequency and the phase of precipitation, while the second product is used to assess the snowfall rate. The mean snowfall rate from August 2006 to April 2011 is 171 mm year‚àí1 over the Antarctic ice sheet, north of 82‚ó¶ S. While uncertainties on individual precipitation retrievals from CloudSat data are potentially large, the mean uncertainty should be much smaller, but cannot be easily estimated. There are no in situ measurements of Antarctic precipitation to directly assess the new climatology. However, distributions of both precipitation occurrences and rates generally agree with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data set, the production of which is constrained by various in situ and satellite observations, but does not use any data from CloudSat. The new data set thus offers unprecedented capability to quantitatively assess Antarctic precipitation statistics and rates in climate models.},

Cold-type habits (side planes and bullets) commonly occurred within the outer comma head to the north and northeast of the cyclone center.

              . It is found that the snowflakes exhibit hallmark features of inertial particles in turbulence. The snow motion is analysed in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks by large-scale particle imaging, while sonic anemometry is used to characterize the flow field. Additionally, the snowflake size and morphology are assessed by digital in-line holography. The low volume fraction and mass loading imply a one-way interaction with the turbulent air. Acceleration probability density functions show wide exponential tails consistent with laboratory and numerical studies of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Invoking the assumption that the particle acceleration has a stronger dependence on the Stokes number than on the specific features of the turbulence (e.g. precise Reynolds number and large-scale anisotropy), we make inferences on the snowflakes‚Äô aerodynamic response time. In particular, we observe that their acceleration distribution is consistent with that of particles of Stokes number in the range

The still-air terminal velocities estimated for the resulting range of aerodynamic response times are significantly smaller than the measured snow particle fall speed. This is interpreted as a manifestation of settling enhancement by turbulence, which is observed here for the first time in a natural setting.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the microphysics of winter alpine snowfall occurring in mixed-phase clouds in an inner-Alpine valley during January and February 2014. The available observations include high-resolution polarimetric radar and in situ measurements of the ice-phase and liquidphase components of clouds and precipitation. Radar-based hydrometeor classiÔ¨Åcation suggests that riming is an important factor to favor an efÔ¨Åcient growth of the precipitating mass and correlates with snow accumulation rates at ground level. The time steps during which rimed precipitation is dominant are analyzed in terms of temporal evolution and vertical structure. Snowfall identiÔ¨Åed as rimed often appears after a short time period during which the atmospheric conditions favor wind gusts and updrafts and supercooled liquid water (SLW) is available. When a turbulent atmospheric layer persists for several hours and ensures continuous SLW generation, riming can be sustained longer and large accumulations of snow at ground level can be generated. The microphysical interpretation and the meteorological situation associated with one such event are detailed in the paper. The vertical structure of polarimetric radar observations during intense snowfall classiÔ¨Åed as rimed shows a peculiar maximum of speciÔ¨Åc differential phase shift Kdp, associated with large number concentrations and riming of anisotropic crystals. Below this Kdp peak there is usually an enhancement in radar reÔ¨Çectivity ZH, proportional to the Kdp enhancement and interpreted as aggregation of ice crystals. These signatures seem to be recurring during intense snowfall.},

To determine how cloud properties vary with environmental conditions, in situ data collected during different Ô¨Åeld projects processed by different groups must be used. However, because of the diverse algorithms and codes that are used to process measurements, it can be challenging to compare the results. Therefore it is vital to understand both the limitations of speciÔ¨Åc probes and uncertainties introduced by processing algorithms. Since there is currently no universally accepted framework regarding how in situ measurements should be processed, there is a need for a general reference that describes the most commonly applied algorithms along with their strengths and weaknesses. Methods used to process data from bulk water probes, single-particle light-scattering spectrometers and cloud-imaging probes are reviewed herein, with emphasis on measurements of the ice phase. Particular attention is paid to how uncertainties, caveats, and assumptions in processing algorithms affect derived products since there is currently no consensus on the optimal way of analyzing data. Recommendations for improving the analysis and interpretation of in situ data include the following: establishment of a common reference library of individual processing algorithms, better documentation of assumptions used in these algorithms, development and maintenance of sustainable community software for processing in situ observations, and more studies that compare different algorithms with the same benchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {A dual-wavelength radar method to estimate snowfall rate has been developed. The method suggests taking simultaneous and collocated reÔ¨Çectivity measurements at two radar wavelengths. Snowfall backscattering at one of these wavelengths should be in the Rayleigh regime or sufÔ¨Åciently close to this regime, while backscattering at the other wavelength should be substantially outside this regime for typical snowÔ¨Çake sizes. Combinations of Ka-band (for a shorter wavelength) and X-, C-, or S-band (for a longer wavelength) radar measurements satisfy this requirement. The logarithmic difference between reÔ¨Çectivities at these two wavelengths provides an independent estimate of snowÔ¨Çake median size Dm, which exhibits a very low sensitivity to snowÔ¨Çake density and details of the size distribution. The estimates of Dm and radar reÔ¨Çectivities Ze at the longer wavelength are then used to obtain snowfall rate R from the Ze‚ÄìR‚ÄìDm relationships, which have a snowÔ¨Çake effective density ‚ê≥e as a ‚Äò‚Äòtuning‚Äô‚Äô parameter. The independent information about snowÔ¨Çake characteristic size accounts for much of the improvement of the dual-wavelength method over traditional, singleparameter Ze‚ÄìR relationships.},

The electronic noise correction rendered the radar particle size retrievals below 0.7-mm drop diameters invalid; exponential extrapolation of the spectrum below drop diameters of 0.7 mm decreased the rain intensity up to 20\%. Proper Mie corrections to the particle backscatter cross sections decreased the rain intensity between 5\% and 30\%. Calibration of the radar against a Joss‚ÄìWaldvogel disdrometer led to a decrease in rain intensity of 49\%.

The scattering databases computed from simulated aggregates for small-to-moderate particle sizes are combined with a simple scattering model for large particle sizes to characterize snowscattering properties over the full range of particle sizes. With use of the single-scattering results, the snow retrieval lookup tables can be formed in a way that directly links the Ku- and Ka-band radar reÔ¨Çectivities to snow water content and equivalent snowfall rate without use of the derived PSD parameters. A sensitivity study of the retrieval results to the PSD and scattering models is performed to better understand the dualwavelength retrieval uncertainties.

Threedimensional tracks of ice crystals falling through the slightly supersaturated environment were obtained from the reconstruction of sequential holographic images, automated detection of the crystals in the hologram reconstructions, and particle tracking. Through collection of the crystals and investigation under a microscope before and after melting, crystal mass was determined as a function of size.

Errors associated with the observation geometry and the measured particle size distribution (PSD) are addressed by devising a simple correction procedure. The value of the correction factor is determined by comparison of the retrieved precipitation accumulation with weighing-gauge measurements. Derived mass‚Äìdimensional relations are represented in the power-law form m 5 amDbm.

From the derived microphysical properties, event-speciÔ¨Åc relations between the equivalent reÔ¨Çectivity factor Ze and snowfall precipitation rate S (Ze 5 azsSbzs ) are determined. For the studied events, the prefactor of the Ze‚ÄìS relation varied between 53 and 782 and the exponent was in the range of 1.19‚Äì1.61. The dependence of the factors azs and bzs on the m(D) relation and PSD are investigated. The exponent of the Ze‚ÄìS relation mainly depends on the exponent of the m(D) relation, whereas the prefactor azs depends on both the intercept parameter N0 of the PSD and the prefactors of the m(D) and y(D) relations. Changes in azs for a given N0 are shown to be linked to changes in liquid water path, which can be considered to be a proxy for degree of riming.},

to determining the dominant type of hydrometeor populating a given radar

the secondary hydrometeor types present in a volume ‚Äì the issue of
hydrometeor de-mixing. The present study relies on the semi-supervised
hydrometeor classification proposed by Besic et¬†al. (2016) but nevertheless
results in solutions and conclusions of a more general character and

de-mixing approach is proposed, inspired by the conventional coherent and
linear decomposition methods widely employed across different remote-sensing
disciplines. Intrinsically related to the concept of entropy, introduced in
the context of the radar hydrometeor classification in Besic et¬†al. (2016), the
proposed method, based on the hypothesis of the reduced random interferences
of backscattered signals, estimates the proportions of different hydrometeor
types in a given radar sampling volume, without considering the neighboring
spatial context. Plausibility and performances of the method are evaluated
using C- and X-band radar measurements, compared with hydrometeor properties
derived from a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera instrument. In the second part,
we examine the influence of the potential residual random interference
contribution in the backscattering from different hydrometeors populating a
radar sampling volume. This part consists in adapting and testing the
techniques commonly used in conventional incoherent decomposition methods to
the context of weather radar polarimetry. The impact of the residual
incoherency is found to be limited, justifying the hypothesis of the reduced
random interferences even in a case of mixed volumes and confirming the
applicability of the proposed bin-based approach, which essentially relies on
first-order statistics.},

For an Arctic nimbostratus ice cloud collected on 1 April 2008 during the Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) campaign, the capability of this synergistic instrument to retrieve cloud properties and to characterize the cloud phase at scales smaller than a kilometer, which is crucial for cloud process analysis, is demonstrated. A variational approach, which combines radar and lidar, is used to retrieve the ice-water content (IWC), extinction, and effective radius. The combination of radar and lidar is shown to provide better retrievals than do stand-alone methods and, in general, the radar overestimates and the lidar underestimates IWC. As the sampled ice cloud was simultaneously observed by CloudSat and Cloud‚ÄìAerosol Lidar and Infrared PathÔ¨Ånder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellites, a new way to assess satellite cloud products by combining in situ and active remote sensing measurements is identiÔ¨Åed. It was then possible to compare RALI to three satellite ice cloud products: CloudSat, CALIPSO, and the Cloud-Aerosol-Water-Radiation Interactions (ICARE) center‚Äôs radar‚Äìlidar project (DARDAR).},

Analyses of CASP II aircraft, surface, satellite, and radar observations collected during an intensive study of the origin and development of 9 mm hœ™1 precipitation containing 4‚Äì5-cm diameter snowÔ¨Çakes are compared in this article with results of the MM5 (mesoscale) and Mitchell (microphysical) models.

The Mitchell analytical‚Äìnumerical model was used to improve the understanding of the microphysical processes that led to the development of the very large snowÔ¨Çakes. A synthesis of results using the different techniques leads to the conclusion that the snowÔ¨Çakes originated as 3‚Äì5-mm dendritic crystals in an area of weak convective instability at 5 km and were transported downwind in a strongly sheared airÔ¨Çow. The dendrites aggregated, fell into an existing snowzone (supported in some regions by vertical motion with velocities ranging from 0.2‚Äì0.6 m sœ™1), and continued to descend along a deep, downward sloping layer with temperatures near 0–äC. Rapid aggregation occurred in the near 0–äC region in particular and without appreciable particle breakup.

This alleviation of the data and annotation requirements offers tantalising prospects for tractable and affordable applications in computer vision and healthcare. Finally, disentangled representations can offer model explainability and can help us understand the underlying causal relations of the factors of variation, increasing their suitability for real-world deployment. In this tutorial paper, we will offer an overview of the disentangled representation learning, its building blocks and criteria, and discuss applications in computer vision and medical imaging.

GANs learns complex and high-dimensional distributions implicitly over images, audio, and data.

Recently, to address these challenges, several solutions for better design and optimization of GANs have been investigated based on techniques of re-engineered network architectures, new objective functions and alternative optimization algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing survey that has particularly focused on broad and systematic developments of these solutions. In this study, we perform a comprehensive survey of the advancements in GANs design and optimization solutions proposed to handle GANs challenges. We first identify key research issues within each design and optimization technique and then propose a new taxonomy to structure solutions by key research issues. In accordance with the taxonomy, we provide a detailed discussion on different GANs variants proposed within each solution and their relationships.

We also identify the GAN models in the literature that partially satisfy these conditions and demonstrate the importance of all the components required, through ablative studies on multiple real world image datasets.

	abstract = {In scientific visualization, two obstacles prevent the full use of heterogeneous networks of powerful workstations: data access and data representation. Low-level sequentialdata access ties visualization applications to application- specific formats. Machine-dependent data representations make it difficult to distribute applications across networks or to display output from programs running on different workstation architectures simultaneously. The Network Common Data Form is a data abstraction for storing and retrieving multidimensional data. MetCDF is distributed as a software library that provides a concrete implementation of that abstraction. The implementation provides a machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Thus NetCDF is more than just another data format. Together, the abstraction, library, and data format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific information. NetCDF has proven useful for supporting objects that contain dissimilar kinds of data in a heterogeneous network environment and for writing application software that does not depend on application-specific formats. NetCDF data achieve independence from applicationspecific formats because the data are self-describing. This means that a NetCDF data set includes information defining the data it contains. NetCDF data achieve independence from particular machine representations by using a nonproprietary standard for external data representation. Programs that use the NetCDF interface can thus read and write data in a form that is more widely usable than machinedependent binary data files. NetCDF files can provide a way to encapsulate structured scientific data for use among multiple application programs, and thus, these files can help to support high-level data access and shell-level application programming. ¬© 1990 IEEE},

	abstract = {Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success for image restoration (IR) and provided hierarchical features at the same time. However, most deep CNN based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-quality images; thereby, resulting in relatively-low performance. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in IR, by making a better tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness in exploiting the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-The-Art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for the task of unsupervised learning of 3D representations from natural images. Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner.},

In particular, we show the effectiveness of a piecewise color enhancement module trained with weak supervision, and extend the proposed EnhanceGAN framework to learning a deep filtering-based aesthetic enhancer. The full differentiability of our image enhancement operators enables the training of EnhanceGAN in an end-to-end manner. We further demonstrate the capability of EnhanceGAN in learning aesthetic-based image cropping without any groundtruth cropping pairs. Our weakly-supervised EnhanceGAN reports competitive quantitative results on aesthetic-based color enhancement as well as automatic image cropping, and a user study confirms that our image enhancement results are on par with or even preferred over professional enhancement.},

However, there has thus far been little related research to summarize the different deep learning techniques for image denoising. In this paper, we offer a comparative study of deep techniques in image denoising. We first classify the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for additive white noisy images; the deep CNNs for real noisy images; the deep CNNs for blind denoising and the deep CNNs for hybrid noisy images, which represents the combination of noisy, blurred and low-resolution images. Then, we analyze the motivations and principles of the different types of deep learning methods. Next, we compare the state-of-the-art methods on public denoising datasets in terms of quantitative and qualitative analyses.

In this paper, we propose ClusterGAN as a new mechanism for clustering using GANs. By sampling latent variables from a mixture of one-hot encoded variables and continuous latent variables, coupled with an inverse network (which projects the data to the latent space) trained jointly with a clustering specific loss, we are able to achieve clustering in the latent space. Our results show a remarkable phenomenon that GANs can preserve latent space interpolation across categories, even though the discriminator is never exposed to such vectors.

	abstract = {Deep clustering has increasingly been demonstrating superiority over conventional shallow clustering algorithms. Deep clustering algorithms usually combine representation learning with deep neural networks to achieve this performance, typically optimizing a clustering and non-clustering loss. In such cases, an autoencoder is typically connected with a clustering network, and the final clustering is jointly learned by both the autoencoder and clustering network. Instead, we propose to learn an autoencoded embedding and then search this further for the underlying manifold. For simplicity, we then cluster this with a shallow clustering algorithm, rather than a deeper network. We study a number of local and global manifold learning methods on both the raw data and autoencoded embedding, concluding that UMAP in our framework is best able to find the most clusterable manifold in the embedding, suggesting local manifold learning on an autoencoded embedding is effective for discovering higher quality discovering clusters. We quantitatively show across a range of image and time-series datasets that our method has competitive performance against the latest deep clustering algorithms, including out-performing current state-of-the-art on several. We postulate that these results show a promising research direction for deep clustering. The code can be found at https://github.com/rymc/n2d},

MARTA GANs consists of both a generative model G and a discriminative model D. We treat D as a feature extractor. To fit the complex properties of remote sensing data, we use a fusion layer to merge the mid-level and global features. G can produce numerous images that are similar to the training data; therefore, D can learn better representations of remotely sensed images using the training data provided by G. The classification results on two widely used remote sensing image databases show that the proposed method significantly improves the classification performance compared with other state-of-theart methods.},

As such, their dimensional properties, mass, and projected area can be related using fractal geometry. In cloud microphysics, power-law mass (m)‚Äì and area (A)‚Äìdimensional (D) relationships (e.g., m 5 aDb) incorporate different manifestations of the fractal dimension as the exponent (b). In this study a self-consistent technique is derived for determining the mass and projected area properties of ice particles from fractal geometry. A computer program was developed to simulate the crystal aggregation process. The fractal dimension of the simulated aggregates was estimated using the box counting method in three dimensions as well as for two-dimensional projected images of the aggregates. The two- and three-dimensional fractal dimension values were found to be simply related. This relationship enabled the development of mass‚Äìdimensional relationships analytically from cloud particle images. This technique was applied to data collected during two Ô¨Åeld projects. The exponent in the mass‚Äìdimensional relationship, the fractal dimension, was found to be between 2.0 and 2.3 with a dependence on temperature noted for both datasets. The coefÔ¨Åcient a in the mass‚Äìdimensional relationships was derived in a self-consistent manner. Temperature-dependent mass‚Äìdimensional relationships have been developed. Cloud ice water content estimated using the temperature-dependent relationship and particle size distributions agreed well with directly measured ice water content values. The results are appropriate for characterizing cloud particle properties in clouds with high concentrations of ice crystal aggregates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Polarimetric radar systems are commonly used to study the microphysics of precipitation. While they offer continuous measurements with a large spatial coverage, retrieving information about the microphysical processes that govern the evolution of snowfall from the polarimetric signal is challenging. The present study develops a new method, called process identification based on vertical gradient signs (PIVSs), to spatially identify the occurrence of the main microphysical processes (aggregation and riming, crystal growth by vapor deposition and sublimation) in snowfall from dual-polarization Doppler radar scans. We first derive an analytical framework to assess in which meteorological conditions the local vertical gradients of radar variables reliably inform about microphysical processes. In such conditions, we then identify regions dominated by (i)¬†vapor deposition, (ii)¬†aggregation and riming and (iii)¬†snowflake sublimation and possibly snowflake breakup, based on the sign of the local vertical gradients of the reflectivity ZH and the differential reflectivity ZDR. The method is then applied to data from two frontal snowfall events, namely one in coastal Ad√©lie Land, Antarctica, and one in the Taebaek Mountains in South Korea. The validity of the method is assessed by comparing its outcome with snowflake observations, using a multi-angle snowflake camera, and with the output of a hydrometeor classification, based on polarimetric radar signal. The application of the method further makes it possible to better characterize and understand how snowfall forms, grows and decays in two different geographical and meteorological contexts. In particular, we are able to automatically derive and discuss the altitude and thickness of the layers where each process prevails for both case studies. We infer some microphysical characteristics in terms of radar variables from statistical analysis of the method output (e.g., ZH and ZDR distribution for each process). We, finally, highlight the potential for extensive application to cold precipitation events in different meteorological contexts.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A new comprehensive cloud‚Äìprecipitation‚Äìmeteorological observatory has been established at Princess Elisabeth base, located in the escarpment zone of Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica. The observatory consists of a set of ground-based remote-sensing instruments (ceilometer, infrared pyrometer and vertically profiling precipitation radar) combined with automatic weather station measurements of near-surface meteorology, radiative fluxes, and snow height. In this paper, the observatory is presented and the potential for studying the evolution of clouds and precipitating systems is illustrated by case studies. It is shown that the synergetic use of the set of instruments allows for distinguishing ice, liquid-containing clouds and precipitating clouds, including some information on their vertical extent. In addition, wind-driven blowing snow events can be distinguished from deeper precipitating systems. Cloud properties largely affect the surface radiative fluxes, with liquid-containing clouds dominating the radiative impact. A statistical analysis of all measurements (in total 14 months mainly during summer‚Äìbeginning of winter) indicates that these liquid-containing clouds occur during as much as 20\% of the cloudy periods. The cloud occurrence shows a strong bimodal distribution with clear-sky conditions 51\% of the time and complete overcast conditions 35\% of the time. Snowfall occurred during 17\% of the cloudy periods with a predominance of light precipitation and only rare events with snowfall {\textgreater}1 mm h‚àí1 water equivalent (w.e.). Three of such intense snowfall events occurred during 2011 contributing to anomalously large annual surface mass balance (SMB). Large accumulation events ({\textgreater}10 mm w.e. day‚àí1) during the radar-measurement period of 26 months were always associated with snowfall, but at the same time other snowfall events did not always lead to accumulation. The multiyear deployment of a precipitation radar in Antarctica allows for assessing the contribution of the snowfall to the local SMB and comparing it to the other SMB components. During 2012, snowfall rate was 110 ¬± 20 mm w.e. yr‚àí1, from which surface and drifting snow sublimation removed together 23\%. Given the measured yearly SMB of 52 ¬± 3 mm w.e., the residual term of 33 ¬± 21 mm w.e. yr‚àí1 was attributed to the wind-driven snow erosion. In general, this promising set of robust instrumentation allows for improved insight into cloud and precipitation processes in Antarctica and can be easily deployed at other Antarctic stations.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Droplet formation provides a direct microphysical link between aerosols and
clouds (liquid or mixed-phase), and its adequate description poses a major
challenge for any atmospheric model. Observations are critical for
evaluating and constraining the process. To this end, aerosol size
distributions, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), hygroscopicity, and lidar-derived
vertical velocities were observed in alpine mixed-phase clouds during the
Role of Aerosols and Clouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow (RACLETS) field
campaign in the Davos, Switzerland, region during February and March 2019.
Data from the mountain-top site of Weissfluhjoch (WFJ) and the valley site
of Davos Wolfgang are studied. These observations are coupled with a
state-of-the-art droplet activation parameterization to investigate the
aerosol‚Äìcloud droplet link in mixed-phase clouds. The mean CCN-derived
hygroscopicity parameter, Œ∫, at WFJ ranges between 0.2‚Äì0.3,
consistent with expectations for continental aerosols. Œ∫ tends to
decrease with size, possibly from an enrichment in organic material
associated with the vertical transport of fresh ultrafine particle emissions
(likely from biomass burning) from the valley floor in Davos. The
parameterization provides a droplet number that agrees with observations to
within ‚àº‚Äâ25‚Äâ\%. We also find that the susceptibility of
droplet formation to aerosol concentration and vertical velocity variations
can be appropriately described as a function of the standard deviation of
the distribution of updraft velocities, œÉw, as the droplet
number never exceeds a characteristic limit, termed the ‚Äúlimiting droplet
number‚Äù, of ‚àº‚Äâ150‚Äì550‚Äâcm‚àí3, which depends solely on
œÉw. We also show that high aerosol levels in the valley, most likely from anthropogenic activities, increase the cloud droplet number, reduce cloud supersaturation ({\textless}‚Äâ0.1‚Äâ\%), and shift the clouds to a state that is less susceptible to changes in aerosol concentrations and very sensitive to vertical velocity variations. The transition from an aerosol to velocity-limited regime
depends on the ratio of cloud droplet number to the limiting droplet number,
as droplet formation becomes velocity limited when this ratio exceeds 0.65.
Under such conditions, droplet size tends to be minimal, reducing the
likelihood that large drops are present that would otherwise promote
glaciation through rime splintering and droplet shattering. Identifying
regimes where droplet number variability is dominated by dynamical ‚Äì rather
than aerosol ‚Äì changes is key for interpreting and constraining when and
which types of aerosol effects on clouds are active.},

To illustrate the available data, measurements corresponding to the four precipitation events with the largest accumulation are presented. The synoptic situations of these events were contrasted and inÔ¨Çuenced the precipitation type and accumulation. The hydrometeor classiÔ¨Åcations reveal that aggregate snowÔ¨Çakes were dominant and that some events featured signiÔ¨Åcant riming. The combination of dual-polarisation variables and high-resolution Doppler spectra with ground-level snowÔ¨Çake images makes this dataset particularly suited to study snowfall microphysics in a region where such measurements were not available before.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The first results of a campaign of intensive observation of precipitation in Dumont d'Urville, Antarctica, are presented. Several instruments collected data from November 2015 to February 2016 or longer, including a polarimetric radar (MXPol), a Micro Rain Radar (MRR), a weighing gauge (Pluvio2), and a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). These instruments collected the first ground-based measurements of precipitation in the region of Ad√©lie Land (Terre Ad√©lie), including precipitation microphysics. Microphysical observations during the austral summer 2015/2016 showed that, close to the ground level, aggregates are the dominant hydrometeor type, together with small ice particles (mostly originating from blowing snow), and that riming is a recurring process. Eleven percent of the measured particles were fully developed graupel, and aggregates had a mean riming degree of about 30‚ÄØ\%. Spurious precipitation in the Pluvio2 measurements in windy conditions, leading to phantom accumulations, is observed and partly removed through synergistic use of MRR data. The yearly accumulated precipitation of snow (300‚ÄØm above ground), obtained by means of a local conversion relation of MRR data, trained on the Pluvio2 measurement of the summer period, is estimated to be 815‚ÄØmm of water equivalent, with a confidence interval ranging between 739.5 and 989‚ÄØmm. Data obtained in previous research from satellite-borne radars, and the ERA-Interim reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provide lower yearly totals: 655‚ÄØmm for ERA-Interim and 679‚ÄØmm for the climatological data over DDU. ERA-Interim overestimates the occurrence of low-intensity precipitation events especially in summer, but it compensates for them by underestimating the snowfall amounts carried by the most intense events. Overall, this paper provides insightful examples of the added values of precipitation monitoring in Antarctica with a synergistic use of in situ and remote sensing measurements.},

APRES3 (Antarctic Precipitation, Remote Sensing from Surface and Space) is a program dedicated to improving the observation of Antarctic precipitation, both from the surface and from space, to assess climatologies and evaluate and ameliorate meteorological and climate models. A Ô¨Åeld measurement campaign was deployed at Dumont d‚ÄôUrville station at the coast of Ad√©lie Land in Antarctica, with an intensive observation period from November 2015 to February 2016 using X-band and K-band radars, a snow gauge, snowÔ¨Çake cameras and a disdrometer, followed by continuous radar monitoring through 2016 and beyond. Among other results, the observations show that a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of precipitation sublimates in a dry surface katabatic layer before it reaches and accumulates at the surface, a result derived from proÔ¨Åling radar measurements.

	abstract = {Abstract. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment¬†(SPICE) involved extensive field intercomparisons of automated instruments for measuring snow during the 2013/2014¬†and 2014/2015¬†winter seasons. A key outcome of SPICE was the development of transfer functions for the wind bias adjustment of solid precipitation measurements using various precipitation gauge and wind shield configurations. Due to the short intercomparison period, the data set was not sufficiently large to develop and evaluate transfer functions using
independent precipitation measurements, although on average the adjustments
were effective at reducing the bias in unshielded gauges from ‚àí33.4‚Äâ\% to 1.1‚Äâ\%. The present analysis uses data collected at eight SPICE sites over the 2015/2016¬†and 2016/2017¬†winter periods, comparing 30‚Äâmin adjusted and unadjusted measurements from Geonor¬†T-200B3 and OTT¬†Pluvio2
precipitation gauges in different shield configurations to the WMO Double
Fence Automated Reference¬†(DFAR) for the evaluation of the transfer function. Performance is assessed in terms of relative total catch¬†(RTC),
root mean square error¬†(RMSE), Pearson correlation¬†(r), and percentage of
events¬†(PEs) within 0.1‚Äâmm of the DFAR. Metrics are reported for combined
precipitation types and for snow only. The evaluation shows that the
performance varies substantially by site. Adjusted RTC varies from 54‚Äâ\% to 123‚Äâ\%, RMSE from 0.07¬†to 0.38‚Äâmm, r¬†from¬†0.28 to¬†0.94, and PEs¬†from
37‚Äâ\% to 84‚Äâ\%, depending on precipitation phase, site, and gauge
configuration (gauge and wind screen type). Generally, windier sites, such as Haukeliseter (Norway) and Bratt's Lake (Canada), exhibit a net under-adjustment (RTC of 54‚Äâ\% to 83‚Äâ\%), while the less windy sites, such
as Sodankyl√§ (Finland) and Caribou Creek (Canada), exhibit a net
over-adjustment (RTC of 102‚Äâ\% to 123‚Äâ\%). Although the application of
transfer functions is necessary to mitigate wind bias in solid precipitation measurements, especially at windy sites and for unshielded gauges, the variability in the performance metrics among sites suggests that the functions be applied with caution.},

Radar measurements were complemented with several weather stations deployed in an altitude range from 1500 to 3100 m as well as with a Ô¨Åxed GPS ground station that was used to infer integrated water vapor estimates. Around 8000 vertical proÔ¨Åles of polarimetric radar observables above the melting layer collected during two months are analyzed. First, the behavior of the mean proÔ¨Åles of reÔ¨Çectivity at horizontal polarization Zh, differential reÔ¨Çectivity Zdr, copolar cross correlation rhv, and speciÔ¨Åc differential phase shift Kdp are interpreted from a microphysical point of view. It is shown that the whole evolution of snowÔ¨Çakes, from pristine crystals at temperatures around 2308C to dendritic crystals around 2158C, to large aggregates around 08C, is well captured by the polarimetric radar variables. In a second step, the proÔ¨Åles are analyzed as functions of high and low water vapor and snow accumulation conditions. It is found that the vertical proÔ¨Åles of polarimetric radar variables have distinct features in low versus high water vapor conditions. High water vapor conditions appear to favor the occurrence of crystal aggregates at high altitudes/low temperatures. It is shown with a hydrometeor identiÔ¨Åcation scheme that graupel-like particles are found to be dominant right above the melting layer for snow events with high accumulation intensities. The present analyses show that measurements from X-band dual-polarization radar can be useful to characterize the dominant microphysical processes during precipitation in mountainous regions.},

	abstract = {Doppler cloud radars are amazing tools to characterize cloud and fog properties and to improve their representation in models. However, commercially available cloud radars (35 and 95 GHz) are still very expensive, which hinders their widespread deployment. This study presents the development of a lowercost semioperational 95-GHz Doppler cloud radar called the Bistatic Radar System for Atmospheric Studies (BASTA). To drastically reduce the cost of the instrument, a different approach is used compared to traditional pulsed radars: instead of transmitting a large amount of energy for a very short time period (as a pulse), a lower amount of energy is transmitted continuously. By using a speciÔ¨Åc signal processing technique, the radar can challenge expensive radars and provide high-quality measurements of cloud and fog. The latest version of the instrument has a sensitivity of about 250 dBZ at 1 km for 3-s integration and a vertical resolution of 25 m. The BASTA radar currently uses four successive modes for speciÔ¨Åc applications: the 12.5-m vertical resolution mode is dedicated to fog and low clouds, the 25-m mode is for liquid and ice midtropospheric clouds, and the 100- and 200-m modes are ideal for optically thin high-level ice clouds. The advantages of such a radar for calibration procedures and Ô¨Åeld operations are also highlighted. The radar comes with a set of products dedicated to cloud and fog studies. For instance, cloud mask, corrected Doppler velocity, and multimode products combining the high-sensitivity mode and high-resolution modes are provided.},

New features of the system include an optimally beam-matched radar‚Äìradiometer; a vertical resolution of up to 5 m with sensitivities down to 262 dBZ at 100-m distance; adjustable measurement conÔ¨Ågurations within the vertical column to account for different observational requirements; an automatic regulation of the transmitter power to avoid receiver saturation; and a high-powered blowing system that prevents hydrometeors from adhering to the radome. JOYRAD-94 has been calibrated with an uncertainty of 0.5 dB that was assessed by observing a metal sphere in the radar‚Äôs far Ô¨Åeld and by comparing radar reÔ¨Çectivities to a collocated 35-GHz radar. The calibrations of the radar receiver and the radiometric receiver are performed via a two-point calibration with liquid nitrogen. The passive channel at 89 GHz is particularly useful for deriving an estimate of the liquid water path (LWP). The developed retrieval shows that the LWP can be retrieved with an RMS uncertainty (not including potential calibration offsets) of about 615 g m22 when constraining the integrated water vapor from an external source with an uncertainty of 62 kg m22. Finally, a dealiasing method [dual-radar dealiasing method (DRDM)] for FMCW Doppler spectra is introduced that combines measurements of two collocated radars with different measurement setups. The DRDM ensures high range resolution with a wide unambiguous Doppler velocity range.},

The MRR is a low-cost, portable radar system that requires minimum supervision in the Ô¨Åeld. As such, the MRR is a frequently used radar system for conducting precipitation research. Current MRR drawbacks are the lack of a sophisticated post-processing algorithm to improve its sensitivity (currently at +3 dBz), spurious artefacts concerning radar receiver noise and the lack of high quality Doppler radar moments. Here we propose an improved processing method which is especially suited for snow observations and provides reliable values of effective reÔ¨Çectivity, Doppler velocity and spectral width. The proposed method is freely available on the web and features a noise removal based on recognition of the most signiÔ¨Åcant peak. A dynamic dealiasing routine allows observations even if the Nyquist velocity range is exceeded. Collocated observations over 115 days of a MRR and a pulsed 35.2 GHz MIRA35 cloud radar show a very high agreement for the proposed method for snow, if reÔ¨Çectivities are larger than ‚àí5 dBz. The overall sensitivity is increased to ‚àí14 and ‚àí8 dBz, depending on range.

	abstract = {The increasing availability of sensors imaging cloud and precipitation particles, like the Multi-Angle SnowÔ¨Çake Camera (MASC), has resulted in datasets comprising millions of images of falling snowÔ¨Çakes. Automated classiÔ¨Åcation is required for effective analysis of such large datasets. While supervised classiÔ¨Åcation methods have been developed for this purpose in recent years, their ability to generalize is limited by the representativeness of their labeled training datasets, which are affected by the subjective judgment of the expert and require signiÔ¨Åcant manual effort to derive. An alternative is unsupervised classiÔ¨Åcation, which seeks to divide a dataset into distinct classes without expert-provided labels. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised classiÔ¨Åcation scheme based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) that learns to extract the key features from the snowÔ¨Çake images. Each image is then associated with a distribution of points in the feature space, and these distributions are used as the basis of K-medoids classiÔ¨Åcation and hierarchical clustering. We found that the classiÔ¨Åcation scheme is able to separate the dataset into distinct classes, each characterized by a particular size, shape and texture of the snowÔ¨Çake image, providing signatures of the microphysical properties of the snowÔ¨Çakes. This Ô¨Ånding is supported by a comparison of the results to an existing supervised scheme. Although training the GAN is computationally intensive, the classiÔ¨Åcation process proceeds directly from images to classes with minimal human intervention and therefore can be repeated for other MASC datasets with minor manual effort. As the algorithm is not speciÔ¨Åc to snowÔ¨Çakes, we also expect this approach to be relevant to other applications.},

We describe the collection, processing, and sorting of this dataset of over 25 000 high-quality Multi-Angle SnowÔ¨Çake Camera (MASC) image chips split nearly evenly between Ô¨Åve geometric classes: aggregate, columnar crystal, planar crystal, graupel, and small particle. Raw images were collected over 32 snowfall events between November 2014 and May 2016 near Greeley, Colorado, and were processed with an automated cropping and normalization algorithm to yield 224 3 224 pixel images containing possible hydrometeors. From the bulk set of over 8 400 000 extracted images, a smaller dataset of 14 793 images was sorted by image quality and recognizability (Q\&R) using manual inspection. A presorting network trained on the Q\&R dataset was applied to all 8 400 0001 images to automatically collect a subset of 283 351 good snowÔ¨Çake images. Roughly 5000 representative examples were then collected from this subset manually for each of the Ô¨Åve geometric classes. With a higher emphasis on inclass variety than our previous work, the Ô¨Ånal dataset yields trained networks that better capture the imperfect cases and diverse forms that occur within the broad categories studied to achieve an accuracy of 96.2\% on a vastly more challenging dataset.},

Here, an evaluation of the microphysical framework used within the GPM-DPR retrieval was undertaken using ground-based disdrometer measurements in both rain and snow with an emphasis on the evaluation of snowfall retrieval. Disdrometer measurements of rain show support for the two separate prescribed relations within the GPM-DPR algorithm between the precipitation rate (R) and the mass weighted mean diameter (Dm) with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) on R of 29\% and 47\% and a mean bias percentage (MBP) of ‚àí6\% and ‚àí20\% for the stratiform and convective relation, respectively. Ground-based disdrometer measurements of snow show higher MAPE and MBP values in the retrieval of R, at 77\% and ‚àí52\%, respectively, compared to the stratiform rain relation. An investigation using the disdrometer-measured fall velocity and mass in the calculation of R and Dm illustrates that the variability found in hydrometeor mass causes a poor correlation between R and Dm in snowfall. The results presented here suggest that R ‚àí Dm retrieval is likely not optimal in snowfall, and other retrieval techniques for R should be explored.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We have developed an algorithm that retrieves the size, number concentration
and density of falling snow from multifrequency radar observations. This
work builds on previous studies that have indicated that three-frequency
radars can provide information on snow density, potentially improving the
accuracy of snow parameter estimates. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian
framework, using lookup tables mapping the measurement space to the state
space, which allows fast and robust retrieval. In the forward model, we
calculate the radar reflectivities using recently published snow scattering
databases. We demonstrate the algorithm using multifrequency airborne radar
observations from the OLYMPEX‚ÄìRADEX field campaign, comparing the retrieval
results to hydrometeor identification using ground-based polarimetric radar
and also to collocated in situ observations made using another aircraft.
Using these data, we examine how the availability of multiple frequencies
affects the retrieval accuracy, and we test the sensitivity of the algorithm to
the prior assumptions. The results suggest that multifrequency radars are
substantially better than single-frequency radars at retrieving snow
microphysical properties. Meanwhile, triple-frequency radars can retrieve
wider ranges of snow density than dual-frequency radars and better locate
regions of high-density snow such as graupel, although these benefits are
relatively modest compared to the difference in retrieval performance between
dual- and single-frequency radars. We also examine the sensitivity of the
retrieval results to the fixed a priori assumptions in the algorithm, showing
that the multifrequency method can reliably retrieve snowflake size, while
the retrieved number concentration and density are affected significantly by
the assumptions.},

            The radar network deployed in southern France during the first special observing period (SOP 1) of the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) was designed to precisely document the 3D structure of moist upstream flow impinging on complex terrain as a function of time, height, and along-barrier distance, and surface rainfall patterns associated with orographic precipitation events. This deployment represents one of the most ambitious field experiments yet, endeavoring to collect high-quality observations of thunderstorms and precipitation systems developing over and in the vicinity of a major mountain chain.
            Radar observations collected during HyMeX represent a valuable, and potentially unique, dataset that will be used to improve our knowledge of physical processes at play within coastal orographic heavy precipitating systems and to develop, and evaluate, novel radar-based products for research and operational activities. This article provides a concise description of this radar network and discusses innovative research ideas based upon preliminary analyses of radar observations collected during this field project with emphasis on the synergetic use of dual-polarimetric radar measurements collected at multiple frequencies.},

Airborne in situ and remote sensing can make critical contributions to progress. Here, a new integrated cloud observation capability developed for the University of Wyoming King Air is described. The suite of instruments includes the Wyoming Cloud Lidar, a 183- GHz microwave radiometer, the Wyoming Cloud Radar, and in situ probes. Combined use of these remote sensor measurements yields more complete descriptions of the vertical structure of cloud microphysical properties and of cloud-scale dynamics than that attainable through ground-based remote sensing or in situ sampling alone. Together with detailed in situ data on aerosols, hydrometeors, water vapor, thermodynamic, and air motion parameters, an advanced observational capability was created to study cloud-scale processes from a single aircraft. The Wyoming Airborne Integrated Cloud Observation (WAICO) experiment was conducted to demonstrate these new capabilities and examples are presented to illustrate the results obtained.},

For this purpose, a large airborne in situ microphysical database is used to perform a detailed error analysis of the IWC‚ÄìZ and IWC‚ÄìZ‚ÄìT methods. This error analysis does not include the error resulting from the mass‚Äìdimension relationship assumed in these methods, although the expected magnitude of this error is bounded in the paper. First, this study reveals that the use of a single IWC‚ÄìZ relationship to estimate IWC at global scale would be feasible up to œ™15 dBZ, but for larger reflectivities (and therefore larger IWCs) different sets of relationships would have to be used for midlatitude and tropical ice clouds. New IWC‚ÄìZ and IWC‚ÄìZ‚ÄìT relationships are then developed from the large aircraft database and by splitting this database into midlatitude and tropical subsets, and an error analysis is performed. For the IWC‚ÄìZ relationships, errors decrease roughly linearly from œ©210\%/œ™70\% for IWC œ≠ 10œ™4 g mœ™3 to œ©75\%/œ™45\% for IWC œ≠ 10œ™2 g mœ™3, are nearly constant (œ©50\%/œ™33\%) for the intermediate IWCs (0.03‚Äì1 g mœ™3), and then linearly increase up to œ©210\%/œ™70\% for the largest IWCs. The error curves have the same shape for the IWC‚ÄìZ‚ÄìT relationships, with a general reduction of errors with respect to the IWC‚ÄìZ relationships. Comparisons with radar‚Äìlidar retrievals confirm these findings. The main improvement brought by the use of temperature as an additional constraint to the IWC retrieval is to reduce both the systematic overestimation and rms differences of the small IWCs (IWC œΩ 0.01 g mœ™3). For the large IWCs, the use of temperature also results in a slight reduction of the rms differences but in a substantial reduction (by a factor of 2) of the systematic underestimation of the large IWCs, probably owing to a better account of the Mie effect when IWC‚ÄìZ relationships are stratified by temperature.},

The main goal of CHOCO-JEX is to characterize the vertical structure of the low-level Choc√≥ jet (ChocoJet) through observations and modeling. Thus, four 7-day intensive observation periods (IOPs) took place during different seasons in 2016, two over land and two over the far eastern Pacific off the coast of Colombia, including the deployment of upper-air soundings four times per day to monitor the predominant diurnal cycle and the synoptic and seasonal variability. Preliminary results show deeper westerly moisture flow and a stronger diurnal cycle over land than over ocean.

SpeciÔ¨Åc differential phase KDP in the ML shows an average correlation of 0.65 with surface rainfall for these cases. Radar reÔ¨Çectivity decreases below the ML by about 2 dB on average while differential reÔ¨Çectivity ZDR is hardly affected, which suggests rain evaporation as the dominating effect. Estimated ice water content or snow water equivalent precipitation rate S in the DGL is correlated with surface rain rates with lead times of 30 min and longer, which opens a pathway for radar-based nowcasting of stratiform precipitation tendencies. Trajectories of snow generated aloft down to the surface are constructed from wind proÔ¨Åles derived both from the nearest radiosounding and radar-based velocity azimuth displays (VAD) to narrow down the location at which the DGL-generated snow reaches the surface as rain. The lagged correlation analysis between KDP in the DGL and reÔ¨Çectivity ZH at that location demonstrates the superiority of the VAD information. Correlation coefÔ¨Åcients up to 0.80 with lead times up to 120 min provide a proof of concept for future nowcasting applications that are based on DGL monitoring. Statistical relations found in our QVP dataset provide a database for estimating intrinsic polarimetric variables from the usual azimuth and elevation scans within and in the vicinity of the ML.},

It is also found that the simulated W-band proÔ¨Åles usually resemble the shapes of the measured brightband proÔ¨Åles even though persistent offsets between them are present.

	abstract = {Dual‚Äêfrequency dual‚Äêpolarization radar observations of the melting of two ice populations in a stratiform rainfall event are presented. The observed phenomenon occurs as a two‚Äêlayer linear depolarization ratio (LDR) signature in a single radar bright band. Doppler spectra observations show that the upper LDR layer is caused by the melting of ice needles, potentially generated by the rime‚Äêsplintering process, while the lower one is mainly due to the melting of background ice particles formed at the cloud top. The melting signal of small needles acts as a unique benchmark for detecting the onset of melting and is used to verify the current methods for the identiÔ¨Åcation of melting layer boundaries. The radar‚Äêderived characteristics of the melting layer are found to be dependent on the radar variable and frequency used. The implications of the presented Ô¨Åndings for radar‚Äêbased studies of precipitation properties in and above the melting layer are also discussed. Plain Language Summary The melting layer of precipitation is a relatively narrow layer where snowÔ¨Çakes melt into raindrops. This layer is clearly visible in weather radar observations and is often called the ‚Äú bright band‚Äù because of the stronger radar return coming from this region. In this paper, we present an event where two layers of melting ice particles, as indicated by dual‚Äêpolarization radar observations, are present inside one bright band. Using state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart radar observations, we show that this phenomenon is caused by the melting of two ice particle populations. The upper layer is due to the melting of ice needles that are potentially generated by the rime‚Äêsplintering process, and the second layer is caused by snowÔ¨Çakes that have formed at the cloud top. The measurements presented illustrate the complexity of ice clouds, where several populations of ice particles might coexist and evolve. We show how the multifrequency radar observations that are currently becoming more and more prevalent can be used to get a glimpse into the precipitation processes taking place in and above the melting layer. We also discuss how currently used methods to describe melting layer properties may be biased depending on what radar observations are used.},

The goal of a number of past studies was to find average relationships between the masses and lengths of ice particles to determine ice water content from in situ data, such as those routinely recorded with two-dimensional imaging probes. The general approach in these past studies was to measure maximum length L and mass M of a dataset of ice crystals collected at a ground site. Linear regression analysis was performed on the logarithms of the data to estimate an average mass-to-length relationship of the form M œ≠ ‚ê£L‚ê§. Relationships were determined for subsets of the dataset based on crystal habit (shape) as well as for the full dataset. In this study, alternative relationships for determining mass using the additional parameters of width W, area A, and perimeter P are explored. A 50\% reduction in rms error in the determination of mass relative to using L alone is achieved using a single parameter that is a combination of L, W, A, and P. The new parameter is designed to take into account the shape of the ice particle without the need to classify the crystals first. An interesting result is that, when applied to the test dataset, the same reduction in rms error is also shown to be achievable using A alone. Using A alone facilitates the reanalysis and improvement of the determination of ice water content from large existing datasets of two-dimensional images, because A is simply the number of occulted pixels in the digital images. Possible sources of error in this study are investigated, as is the usefulness of first segregating the particles into crystal habits.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This study investigates the link between rain and ice microphysics across the melting layer in stratiform rain systems using measurements from vertically pointing multi-frequency Doppler radars.
A novel methodology to examine the variability of the precipitation rate and the mass-weighted melted diameter (Dm) across the melting region is proposed and applied to a 6‚Äâh long case study, observed during the TRIPEx-pol field campaign at the J√ºlich Observatory for Cloud Evolution Core Facility and covering a gamut of ice microphysical processes.
The methodology is based on an optimal estimation (OE) retrieval of particle size distributions (PSDs) and dynamics (turbulence and vertical motions) from observed multi-frequency radar Doppler spectra applied both above and below the melting layer.
First, the retrieval is applied in the rain region; based on a one-to-one conversion of raindrops into snowflakes, the retrieved drop size distributions (DSDs) are propagated upward to provide the mass-flux-preserving PSDs of snow. These ice PSDs are used to simulate radar reflectivities above the melting layer for different snow models and they are evaluated for a consistency with the actual radar measurements.
Second, the OE snow retrieval where Doppler spectra are simulated based on different snow models, which consistently compute fall speeds and electromagnetic properties, is performed. The results corresponding to the best-matching models are then used to estimate snow fluxes and Dm, which are directly compared to the corresponding rain quantities.
For the case study, the total accumulation of rain (2.30‚Äâmm) and the melted equivalent accumulation of snow (1.93‚Äâmm) show a 19‚Äâ\% difference. The analysis suggests that the mass flux through the melting zone is well preserved except the periods of intense riming where the precipitation rates were higher in rain than in the ice above. This is potentially due to additional condensation within the melting zone in correspondence to high relative humidity and collision and coalescence with the cloud droplets whose occurrence is ubiquitous with riming.
It is shown that the mean mass-weighted diameter of ice is strongly related to the characteristic size of the underlying rain except the period of extreme aggregation where breakup of melting snowflakes significantly reduces Dm.
The proposed methodology can be applied to long-term observations to advance our knowledge of the processes occurring across the melting region; this can then be used to improve assumptions underpinning spaceborne radar precipitation retrievals.},

The macrophysical characteristics of supercooled water could be accurately identified by combing the threshold method with the fuzzy logic algorithm. In order to acquire microphysical characteristics of supercooled water in a mixed phase, the unimodal spectral distribution of supercooled water was extracted from a bimodal or trimodal spectral distribution of a mixed phase cloud, which was then used to retrieve the effective radius and liquid water content of supercooled water by using an empirical formula. These retrieved macro- and micro-physical characteristics of supercooled water can be used to guide aircrafts during takeoff, flight, and landing to avoid dangerous areas.},

            Representation of cloud microphysics is a key aspect of simulating clouds. From the early days of cloud modeling, numerical models have relied on an Eulerian approach for all cloud and thermodynamic and microphysics variables. Over time the sophistication of microphysics schemes has steadily increased, from simple representations of bulk masses of cloud and rain in each grid cell, to including different ice particle types and bulk hydrometeor concentrations, to complex schemes referred to as bin or spectral schemes that explicitly evolve the hydrometeor size distributions within each model grid cell. As computational resources grow, there is a clear trend toward wider use of bin schemes, including their use as benchmarks to develop and test simplified bulk schemes. We argue that continuing on this path brings fundamental challenges difficult to overcome. The Lagrangian particle-based probabilistic approach is a practical alternative in which the myriad of cloud and precipitation particles present in a natural cloud is represented by a judiciously selected ensemble of point particles called superdroplets or superparticles. The advantages of the Lagrangian particle-based approach when compared to the Eulerian bin methodology are explained, and the prospects of applying the method to more comprehensive cloud simulations‚Äîfor instance, targeting deep convection or frontal cloud systems‚Äîare discussed.},

            In the past two decades, more than 150 jet engine power-loss and damage events have been attributed to a phenomenon known as ice crystal icing (ICI). Ingestion of large numbers of ice particles into the engine core are thought to be responsible for these events, which typically occur at high altitudes near large convective systems in tropical air masses. In recent years, scientists, engineers, aviation regulators, and airlines from around the world have collaborated to better understand the relevant meteorological processes associated with ICI events, solve critical engineering problems, develop new certification standards, and devise mitigation strategies for the aviation industry. One area of research is the development of nowcasting techniques based on available remote sensing technology and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to identify areas of high ice water content (IWC) and enable the provision of alerts to the aviation industry. Multiple techniques have been developed using geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite products, NWP model fields, and ground-based radar data as the basis for high-IWC products. Targeted field experiments in tropical regions with high incidence of ICI events have provided data for product validation and refinement of these methods. Beginning in 2015, research teams have assembled at a series of annual workshops to exchange ideas and standardize methods for evaluating performance of high-IWC detection products. This paper provides an overview of the approaches used and the current skill for identifying high-IWC conditions. Recommendations for future work in this area are also presented.},

Long-duration, unattended operation of an SVI is feasible because datalogging software provides data compression and the hardware can operate for months in harsh winter conditions. Details of SVI hardware and Ô¨Åeld operation are given. SnowÔ¨Çake size distributions (SSDs) from a storm near Boulder, Colorado, are computed. An SVI is an imaging system, so SVI data can be utilized to compute diverse data products for various applications.

To assess the applicability of 2DC data obtained without antishatter tips previously used in parameterization schemes for numerical models and remote sensing retrievals, the impacts of artifacts on bulk microphysical and scattering properties were examined by quantifying differences between such properties derived from 2DCs with standard and antishatter tips, and with and without the use of shatter detection algorithms using the ISDAC and IDEAS-2011 data. Using either modiÔ¨Åed tips or algorithms changed the quantities dominated by higher-order moments, such as ice water content, bulk extinction, effective radius, mass-weighted terminal velocity, median mass diameter, asymmetry parameter, and single-scatter albedo, at wavenumbers from 5 to 100 cm21 and wavelengths of 0.5‚Äì5 mm by less than 20\%. This is signiÔ¨Åcantly less than the fractional changes quantities dominated by lower-order moments, such as number concentration. The results suggest that model parameterizations and remote sensing techniques based on higherorder moments of ice particle size distributions obtained in conditions similar to those sampled during IDEAS2011 and ISDAC derived from 2DCs are not substantially biased by shattered remnants.},

The classiÔ¨Åcation is achieved using a multinomial logistic regression model. For each airborne probe, the model determines the particle habit (among six classes) based on a large set of geometrical and textural descriptors extracted from the two-dimensional image of a particle. The technique is applied and evaluated using three probes with signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent speciÔ¨Åcations: the high volume precipitation spectrometer, the two-dimensional stereo probe, and the cloud particle imager. Performance and robustness of the method are assessed using standard machine learning tools on the basis of thousands of images manually labeled for each of the considered probes. The three classiÔ¨Åers show good performance characterized by overall accuracies and Heidke skill scores above 90\%. Depending on the application and user preferences, the classiÔ¨Åcation scheme can be easily adapted. For a more precise output, intraclass subclassiÔ¨Åcation can be achieved in a nested fashion, illustrated here with columnar crystals and aggregates. A comparative study of the classiÔ¨Åcation output obtained with the three probes is presented for two aircraft Ô¨Çight periods selected when the three probes were operating together. Results are globally consistent in term of proportions of habit identiÔ¨Åed (once blurry and partial images have been automatically discarded). A perfect agreement is not expected as the three considered probes are sensitive to diÔ¨Äerent particle size range.},

	abstract = {We generated a large number 105,000 of aggregates composed of various monomer types and sizes using an aggregation model. Combined with hydrodynamic theory, we derived ice particle properties such as mass, projected area, and terminal velocity as a function of monomer number and size. This particle ensemble allows us to study the relation of particle properties with a high level of detail which is often not provided by in situ measurements. The ice particle properties change rather smoothly with monomer number. We Ô¨Ånd very little differences in all particle properties between monomers and aggregates at sizes below 1 mm which is in contrast to many microphysics schemes. The impact of the monomer type on the particle properties decreases with increasing monomer number. Whether, for example, the terminal velocity of an aggregate is larger or smaller than an equal‚Äêsize monomer depends mostly on the monomer type. We Ô¨Åtted commonly used power laws as well as Atlas‚Äêtype relations, which represent the saturation of the terminal velocity at large sizes (terminal velocity asymptotically approaching a limiting value) to the data set and tested the impact of incorporating different levels of complexity with idealized simulations using a 1D Lagrangian super particle model. These simulations indicate that it is sufÔ¨Åcient to represent the monomer number dependency of ice particle properties with only two categories (monomers and aggregates). The incorporation of the saturation velocity at larger sizes is found to be important to avoid an overestimation of self‚Äêaggregation of larger snowÔ¨Çakes. Plain Language Summary We have simulated and analyzed the properties, such as mass, area, and terminal fall velocity of snowÔ¨Çakes using a computer model. The snowÔ¨Çakes in the atmosphere form by collisions of ice crystals present in many different shapes. In the computer model, ice crystal shapes typically found in the atmosphere are stuck together to create three‚Äêdimensional snowÔ¨Çakes. The properties of the snowÔ¨Çakes depend on the shape and the number of ice crystals that are stuck together. While in weather and climate models, the properties of ice crystals and snowÔ¨Çakes are often assumed to be very different even if they are of the same size, we Ô¨Ånd very little differences in their properties. Many weather and climate models assume that snowÔ¨Çakes have a higher fall velocity the larger they are, although Ô¨Åeld observations have shown that particles larger than a few millimeters all fall with similar velocity. We Ô¨Åtted new parameterizations of the particle velocities which can remove this deÔ¨Åciency in the models. Finally, we used another model and showed that it might be sufÔ¨Åcient to divide the properties of the ice particles in only two categories. However, it is important to consider the almost constant velocity of the large snowÔ¨Çakes.},

	abstract = {Ground-based observations of ice particle size distribution and ensemble mean density are used to quantify the eÔ¨Äect of riming on snowfall. The rime mass fraction is derived from these measurements by following the approach that is used in a single ice-phase category microphysical scheme proposed for the use in numerical weather prediction models. One of the characteristics of the proposed scheme is that the prefactor of a power law relation that links mass and size of ice particles is determined by the rime mass fraction, while the exponent does not change. To derive the rime mass fraction, a mass-dimensional relation representative of unrimed snow is also determined. To check the validity of the proposed retrieval method, the derived rime mass fraction is converted to the eÔ¨Äective liquid water path that is compared to microwave radiometer observations. Since dual-polarization radar observations are often used to detect riming, the impact of riming on dual-polarization radar variables is studied for diÔ¨Äerential reÔ¨Çectivity measurements. It is shown that the relation between rime mass fraction and diÔ¨Äerential reÔ¨Çectivity is ambiguous, other factors such as change in median volume diameter need also be considered. Given the current interest on sensitivity of precipitation to aerosol pollution, which could inhibit riming, the importance of riming for surface snow accumulation is investigated. It is found that riming is responsible for 5\% to 40\% of snowfall mass. The study is based on data collected at the University of Helsinki Ô¨Åeld station in Hyyti√§l√§ during U.S. Department of Energy Biogenic Aerosols EÔ¨Äects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) Ô¨Åeld campaign and the winter 2014/2015.

Future improvement of the accuracy of weather prediction and climate models relies on a proper description of SIP in numerical simulations. For now, laboratory studies remain a primary tool for developing physically based parameterizations for cloud modeling. Over the past 7 decades, six different SIPidentifying mechanisms have emerged: (1) shattering during droplet freezing, (2) the rime-splintering (Hallett‚ÄìMossop) process, (3) fragmentation due to ice‚Äìice collision, (4) ice particle fragmentation due to thermal shock, (5) fragmentation of sublimating ice, and (6) activation of ice-nucleating particles in transient supersaturation around freezing drops. This work presents a critical review of the laboratory studies related to secondary ice production. While some of the six mechanisms have received little research attention, for others contradictory results have been obtained by different research groups. Unfortunately, despite vast investigative efforts, the lack of consistency and the gaps in the accumulated knowledge hinder the development of quantitative descriptions of any of the six SIP mechanisms.

	abstract = {Abstract‚ÄîThis review paper summarizes current knowledge available for aviation operations related to meteorology and provides suggestions for necessary improvements in the measurement and prediction of weather-related parameters, new physical methods for numerical weather predictions (NWP), and next-generation integrated systems. Severe weather can disrupt aviation operations on the ground or in-Ô¨Çight. The most important parameters related to aviation meteorology are wind and turbulence, fog visibility, aerosol/ash loading, ceiling, rain and snow amount and rates, icing, ice microphysical parameters, convection and precipitation intensity, microbursts, hail, and lightning. Measurements of these parameters are functions of sensor response times and measurement thresholds in extreme weather conditions. In addition to these, airport environments can also play an important role leading to intensiÔ¨Åcation of extreme weather conditions or high impact weather events, e.g., anthropogenic ice fog. To observe meteorological parameters, new remote sensing platforms, namely wind LIDAR, sodars, radars, and geostationary satellites, and in situ instruments at the surface and in the atmosphere, as well as aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles mounted sensors, are becoming more common. At smaller time and space scales (e.g., {\textbackslash} 1 km), meteorological forecasts from NWP models need to be continuously improved for accurate physical parameterizations. Aviation weather forecasts also need to be developed to provide detailed information that represents both deterministic and statistical approaches. In this review, we present available resources and issues for aviation meteorology and evaluate them for required improvements related to measurements, nowcasting, forecasting, and climate change, and emphasize future challenges.},

In this study, individual snowÔ¨Çakes are represented by collections of randomly distributed ice spheres where the size and number of the constituent ice spheres are speciÔ¨Åed by the snowÔ¨Çake mass and surface-area-to-volume ratio (SAV) and the bounding volume of each ice sphere collection is given by the snowÔ¨Çake maximum dimension. Radar backscatter cross sections for the ice sphere collections are calculated at X-, Ku-, Ka-, and W-band frequencies and then used to model triplefrequency radar signatures for exponential snowÔ¨Çake size distributions (SSDs). Additionally, snowÔ¨Çake complexity values obtained from high-resolution multi-view snowÔ¨Çake images are used as an indicator of snowÔ¨Çake SAV to derive snowfall triple-frequency radar signatures. The modeled snowfall triple-frequency radar signatures cover a wide range of triple-frequency signatures that were previously determined from radar reÔ¨Çectivity measurements and illustrate characteristic differences related to snow type, quantiÔ¨Åed through snowÔ¨Çake SAV, and snowÔ¨Çake size. The results show high sensitivity to snowÔ¨Çake SAV and SSD maximum size but are generally less affected by uncertainties in the parameterization of snowÔ¨Çake mass, indicating the importance of snowÔ¨Çake SAV for the interpretation of snowfall triplefrequency radar signatures.},

Despite this diversity, models and observational studies employ fractal or Euclidean geometric measures that are assumed universal for all aggregates. This work therefore seeks to improve understanding and representation of snow aggregate geometry and its evolution by characterizing distributions of both observed and Monte Carlo‚Äìgenerated aggregates. Two separate datasets of best-Ô¨Åt ellipsoid estimates derived from Multi-Angle SnowÔ¨Çake Camera (MASC) observations suggest the use of a bivariate beta distribution model for capturing aggregate shapes. Product moments of this model capture shape effects to within 4\% of observations. This mathematical model is used along with Monte Carlo simulated aggregates to study how combinations of monomer properties affect aggregate shape evolution. Plate aggregates of any aspect ratio produce a consistent ellipsoid shape evolution whereas thin column aggregates evolve to become more spherical. Thin column aggregates yield fractal dimensions much less than the often-assumed value of 2.0. Ellipsoid densities and fractal analogs of density (lacunarity) are much more variable depending on combinations of monomer size and shape. Simple mathematical scaling relationships can explain the persistent triaxial ellipsoid shapes that appear in both observed and modeled aggregates. Overall, both simulations and observations prove aggregates are rarely oblate. Therefore, the use of the proposed bivariate ellipsoid distribution in models will allow for similar-sized aggregates to exhibit a realistic dispersion of masses and fall speeds.},

For each individual image, the method relies on the calculation of a set of geometric and texture-based descriptors to simultaneously identify the hydrometeor type (among six predeÔ¨Åned classes), estimate the degree of riming and detect melting snow. The classiÔ¨Åcation tasks are achieved by means of a regularized multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model trained over more than 3000 MASC images manually labeled by visual inspection. In a second step, the probabilistic information provided by the MLR is weighed on the three stereoscopic views of the MASC in order to assign a unique label to each hydrometeor. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data collected in the Swiss Alps and in Antarctica. The algorithm achieves high performance, with a hydrometeor-type classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy and Heidke skill score of 95 \% and 0.93, respectively. The degree of riming is evaluated by introducing a riming index ranging between zero (no riming) and one (graupel) and characterized by a probable error of 5.5 \%. A validation study is conducted through a comparison with an existing classiÔ¨Åcation method based on two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) data and shows that the two methods are consistent.},

They require little initial preparation, enable the use of smaller training sets through transfer learning techniques, come with large supporting communities and a wealth of resources available, and can be applied and operated by nonexperts. We illustrate both the ease of implementation and the usefulness of operation the CNN architecture offers as a tool for researchers and practitioners utilizing in situ optical observational devices. A training dataset containing 1450 MASC images is developed primarily from two storm events in December 2014 and February 2015 in Greeley, Colorado, by visual inspection of recognizable snowÔ¨Çake geometries. DeÔ¨Åned geometric classes are aggregate, columnar crystal, planar crystal, small particle, and graupel. The CNN trained on this dataset achieves a mean accuracy of 93.4\% and displays excellent generalization (ability to classify new data). In addition, a separate training dataset is developed by sorting snowÔ¨Çakes into three classes and showcasing distinct degrees of riming. The CNN riming degree estimator yields promising initial results but would beneÔ¨Åt from larger training sets.},

In order to measure these properties precisely, optical instruments may be the best choice. The MultiAngle SnowÔ¨Çake Camera (MASC) is a relatively new instrument equipped with three high-resolution cameras to capture the winter precipitation particle images from three non-parallel angles, in addition to measuring the particle fall speed using two pairs of infrared motion sensors. However, the results from the MASC so far are usually presented as monthly or seasonally, and particle sizes are given as histograms, no previous studies have used the MASC for a single storm study, and no researchers use MASC to measure the PSD. We propose the methodology for obtaining the winter precipitation PSD measured by the MASC, and present and discuss the development, implementation, and application of the new technique for PSD computation based on MASC images. Overall, this is the Ô¨Årst study of the MASC-based PSD. We present PSD MASC experiments and results for segments of two snow events to demonstrate the performance of our PSD algorithm. The results show that the self-consistency of the MASC measured single-camera PSDs is good. To cross-validate PSD measurements, we compare MASC mean PSD (averaged over three cameras) with the collocated 2D Video Disdrometer, and observe good agreements of the two sets of results.},

This study aims to complement prior Ô¨Åndings by analyzing the natural variability within snowstorms. The approach consists of (i) deriving the variability of snowÔ¨Çake diameters, aspect ratios, and orientation angles from automated snowÔ¨Çake observations during individual snowstorms, (ii) calculating the corresponding variability of snowÔ¨Çake backscatter cross sections at 24, 35, 94, and 183 GHz, and (iii) evaluating the impact of the analyzed snowÔ¨Çake variability on modeled snowfall equivalent radar reÔ¨Çectivity factors (Ze). For seven snowstorms, the observed natural variability in snowÔ¨Çake diameter, aspect ratio, and orientation leads to distributions of snowÔ¨Çake backscatter cross sections that span up to 6 orders of magnitude. The impact on modeled radar reÔ¨Çectivity is smaller with distributions of Ze values spanning less than 1 order of magnitude and with median absolute deviations and standard deviations of up to 25\%, depending on the analyzed frequency and the applied snowÔ¨Çake parameterization. An assessment of diÔ¨Äerent characterizations of snowÔ¨Çake aspect ratio and orientation indicates that a simplistic description of aspect ratios and orientation angles through constant values which do not correspond with the observed snowÔ¨Çake distributions for the analyzed snowstorm can lead to relative diÔ¨Äerences in modeled Ze of {\textbar}ŒîZe{\textbar} ‚â• 60\%. These diÔ¨Äerences in Ze are generally smaller than uncertainties in Ze associated with the parameterization of snowÔ¨Çake mass but still translate into signiÔ¨Åcant uncertainties for the retrieval of snowfall rates from radar reÔ¨Çectivity measurements.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations of the aggregation and riming of ice crystals are performed to investigate the geometry of rimed aggregate snowflakes. Due to the universality of the geometry of aggregates, the conversion to a graupel-like particle is self-similar and independent from specific properties of the aggregate, when formulated in properly normalized variables. Hence, the particle habit of the primary crystals, the size of the aggregate or the density of the rime mass, does not lead to a structural change in the transition to graupel. Therefore, this transition can be parameterized by a similarity approach using simulations of many individual rimed aggregates. These parameterizations can replace the classic fill-in model used in many cloud models. The parameterizations are applied and tested in a one-dimensional Lagrangian superparticle model to simulate the growth of aggregates in a liquid layer. We find that the similarity model for the geometry of rimed snowflakes leads to a more rapid growth by riming and, hence, an increased precipitation rate compared to the fill-in model. The main reason for this is that the increase of the maximum dimension during the early stages of riming is properly taken into account by the similarity model, whereas it is neglected by the fill-in model.},

High-precipitation events are analyzed at Halvfarryggen situated in the coastal region of DML and at Kohnen Station located in its interior. This study further includes a comprehensive comparison of high precipitation in ERA-Interim with precipitation data from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and snow accumulation measurements from automatic weather stations (AWSs), with the limitations of such a comparison being discussed. The ERA-Interim and AMPS precipitation data agree very well. However, the correspondence between high precipitation in ERA-Interim and high snow accumulation at the AWSs is relatively weak. High-precipitation events at both Halvfarryggen and Kohnen are typically associated with ampliÔ¨Åed upper level waves. This large-scale atmospheric Ô¨Çow pattern is preceded by the downstream development of a Rossby wave train from the eastern South PaciÔ¨Åc several days before the precipitation event. At the surface, a cyclone located over the Weddell Sea is the main synoptic ingredient for high precipitation both at Halvfarryggen and at Kohnen. A blocking anticyclone downstream is not a requirement for high precipitation per se, but a larger share of blocking occurrences during the highest-precipitation days in DML suggests that these blocks strengthen the vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) into DML. A strong link between high precipitation and the IVT perpendicular to the local orography suggests that IVT could be used as a ‚Äúproxy‚Äù for high precipitation, in particular over DML‚Äôs interior.},

As part of the HighLatitude Measurement of Snowfall (HiLaMS) Ô¨Åeld campaign, a Micro Rain Radar (MRR), Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP), and Multi-Angle Snow Camera (MASC) were deployed to the Haukeliseter Test Site run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute during winter 2016/17. This measurement site lies near an elevation of 1000 m in the mountains of southern Norway and houses a double-fence automated reference (DFAR) snow gauge and a comprehensive set of meteorological observations. MASC and PIP observations provided estimates of particle size distribution (PSD), fall speed, and habit. These properties were used as input for a snowfall retrieval algorithm using coincident MRR reÔ¨Çectivity measurements. Retrieved surface snowfall accumulations were evaluated against DFAR observations to quantify retrieval performance as a function of meteorological conditions for the Haukeliseter site. These analyses found differences of less than 10\% between DFAR- and MRR-retrieved estimates over the Ô¨Åeld season when using either PIP or MASC observations for low wind ‚Äò‚Äòupslope‚Äô‚Äô events. Larger biases of at least 50\% were found for high wind ‚Äò‚Äòpulsed‚Äô‚Äô events likely because of sampling limitations in the in situ observations used to constrain the retrieval. However, assumptions of MRR Doppler velocity for mean particle fall speed and a temperature-based PSD parameterization reduced this difference to 116\% for the pulsed events. Although promising, these results ultimately depend upon selection of a snowÔ¨Çake particle model that is well matched to scene environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Recent laboratory experiments and in situ observations have produced results in broad agreement with respect to ice crystal habits in the atmosphere. These studies reveal that the ice crystal habit at 2208C is platelike, extending to 2408C, and not columnar as indicated in many habit diagrams found in atmospheric science journals and texts. These diagrams were typically derived decades ago from laboratory studies, some with inherent habit bias, or from combinations of laboratory and in situ observations at the ground, observations that often did not account for habit modiÔ¨Åcation by precipitation from overlying clouds of varying temperatures. Habit predictions from these diagrams often disagreed with in situ observations at temperatures below 2208C. More recent laboratory and in situ studies have achieved a consensus on atmospheric ice crystal habits that differs from the traditional habit diagrams. These newer results can now be combined to give a comprehensive description of ice crystal habits for the atmosphere as a function of temperature and ice supersaturation for temperatures from 08 to 2708C, a description dominated by irregular and imperfect crystals. Cloud particle imager (CPI) habit observations made during the Second Alliance Icing Research Study (AIRS II) and elsewhere corroborate this comprehensive habit description, and a new habit diagram is derived from these results.},

	abstract = {Ice crystal numbers can exceed the numbers of icenucleating particles (INPs) observed in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) by several orders of magnitude, also at temperatures that are colder than ‚àí 8 ‚ó¶C. This disparity provides circumstantial evidence of secondary ice formation, also other than via the Hallett‚ÄìMossop process. In a new approach, we made use of the fact that planar, branched ice crystals (e.g. dendrites) grow within a relatively narrow temperature range (i.e. ‚àí12 to ‚àí17 ‚ó¶C) and can be analysed individually for INPs using a Ô¨Åeld-deployable drop-freezing assay. The novelty of our approach lies in comparing the growth temperature encoded in the habit of an individual crystal with the activation temperature of the most efÔ¨Åcient INP contained within the same crystal to tell whether it may be the result of primary ice formation. In February and March 2018, we analysed a total of 190 dendritic crystals (‚àº 3 mm median size) deposited within MPCs at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch (3580 m a.s.l.). Overall, one in eight of the analysed crystals contained an INP active at ‚àí17 ‚ó¶C or warmer, while the remaining seven most likely resulted from secondary ice formation within the clouds. The ice multiplication factor we observed was small (8), but relatively stable throughout the course of documentation. These measurements show that secondary ice can be observed at temperatures around ‚àí15 ‚ó¶C and thus advance our understanding of the extent of secondary ice formation in MPCs, even where the multiplication factor is smaller than 10.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Often overlooked in studies of ice growth is how the crystal facets increase in area, that is, grow laterally. This paper reports on observations and applications of such lateral facet growth for vapor-grown ice in air. Using a new crystal-growth chamber, we observed air pockets forming at crystal corners when a sublimated crystal is regrown. This observation indicates that the lateral spreading of a face can, under some conditions, extend as a thin overhang over the adjoining region. We argue that this extension is driven by a flux of surface-mobile molecules across the face to the lateral-growth front. Following the pioneering work on this topic by Akira¬†Yamashita, we call this flux ‚Äúadjoining surface transport‚Äù (AST) and the extension overgrowth ‚Äúprotruding growth‚Äù. Further experiments revealed other types of pockets that are difficult to explain without invoking AST and protruding growth. We develop a simple model for lateral facet growth on a tabular crystal in air, finding that AST is required to explain observations of facet spreading. Applying the AST concept to observed ice and snow crystals, we argue that AST promotes facet spreading, causes protruding growth, and alters layer nucleation rates. In particular, depending on the conditions, combinations of lateral- and normal-growth processes can help explain presently inexplicable secondary features and habits such as air pockets, small circular centers in dendrites, hollow structure, multiple-capped columns, scrolls, sheath clusters, and trigonals. For dendrites and sheaths, AST may increase their maximum dimensions and round their tips. Although these applications presently lack quantitative detail, the overall body of evidence here demonstrates that any complete model of ice growth from the vapor should include such lateral-growth processes.},

Observations indicate that there can be a much broader range of orientation angles, with a larger median value, than has been indicated by previous observational and theoretical studies. The data show that aspect ratio depends on riming extent but that orientation is only weakly dependent on the degree of riming and on particle size. Instead, more vertical orientations for frozen particles become increasingly common with higher turbulence. The results suggest that distributions of size, fall speed, orientation, and aspect ratio may each need to be considered in order to optimize the accuracy of precipitation retrievals using microwave sensors.},

The data show that graupel in low-turbulence conditions has a size-dependent fallspeed distribution with a mode near 1 m s‚àí1, a result that is generally consistent with prior observations. However, the distributions are broadened by turbulence and there is a correspondence between particle density and air temperature.

	abstract = {Abstract. Ground-based measurements of frozen precipitation are heavily influenced by interactions of surface winds with gauge-shield geometry. The Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC), which photographs hydrometeors in free-fall from three different angles while simultaneously measuring their fall speed, has been used in the field at multiple midlatitude and polar locations both with and without wind shielding. Here, we present an analysis of Arctic field observations ‚Äì with and without a Belfort double Alter shield ‚Äì and compare the results to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the airflow and corresponding particle trajectories around the unshielded MASC. MASC-measured fall speeds compare well with Ka-band Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Zenith Radar (KAZR) mean Doppler velocities only when winds are light (‚â§5ms-1) and the MASC is shielded. MASC-measured fall speeds that do not match KAZR-measured velocities tend to fall below a threshold value that increases approximately linearly with wind speed but is generally {\textless}0.5ms-1. For those events with wind speeds ‚â§1.5ms-1, hydrometeors fall with an orientation angle mode of 12‚àò from the horizontal plane, and large, low-density aggregates are as much as 5¬†times more likely to be observed. Simulations in the absence of a wind shield show a separation of flow at the upstream side of the instrument, with an upward velocity component just above the aperture, which decreases the mean particle fall speed by 55‚Äâ\% (74‚Äâ\%) for a wind speed of 5‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1 (10‚Äâm‚Äâs‚àí1). We conclude that accurate MASC observations of the microphysical, orientation, and fall speed characteristics of snow particles require shielding by a double wind fence and restriction of analysis to events where winds are light (‚â§5ms-1). Hydrometeors do not generally fall in still air, so adjustments to these properties' distributions within natural turbulence remain to be determined.},
